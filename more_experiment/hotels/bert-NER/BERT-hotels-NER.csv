and facilities were excellent
and few more minutes to the beach
and fresh clean towels daily although the towels are a little old
and i cannot stress enough about the convenience of this location

and is in a good location
and it had breakfast included it was clean
and it is a short walk to world class shopping at mbk and siam discovery

and pretty close to the central stuff in the city too
and receptionist is very nice
and room service was awesome

and still be a really nice and unpretentious place
and the beach is not far at all
and the bungalow i stayed in had a very comfortable bed and nice linen

and then once you re there if you want to go back to the city center to visit bangkok you have to
and there is a pool
and there were some shops and a 7 11 near by
and this experience make me also interested about u hotel in other location
and this hotel was exactly what we expected spacious room with comfortable bed
and three nights in town
and to be close to the airport so we could fly out as soon as they re opened it
and trying to walk on the sidewalks lol
and unfortunately some rubbish and oil spill on the beach
and up to date with a great location but
and very clean
and very nice our staff friendly
and was served at the fresh restaurant
and were welcomed at bunny burrow by awesome staff and a very good environment
and what a surprise lovely hotel and pool area
and what an absolute gem
and when u walk over to your room
and when you move in to victoria s place
and will recomend this place at any time
and with the andamen bangtao bay resort being at the very south end of the beach
and you can have a room with a balcony area which has access directly into the pool
and you can more or less open the the whole villa onto the massive terrace with breath taking views
andaman white beach resort lies on the western coast of phuket
andara is the best place to stay in phuket hands down
another bonus was the privacy of two bedrooms with en
anyway the restaurant is just the best one in the whole beach
aone beach pattaya is one of the wings of a one hotel
apart from that the staff are very friendly and
apartment is a short walk away from the reception building
apartments are clean and well maintained inside and out
approximately 150 metres from the south end of kata beach
are you in the action of chaweng the hotel is clean the area
area is more relaxed and less hectic than those closer to the city centre
ari is perfect for that and josh hotel was really close to the train station too so it was easy
around 10 minutes walk to terminal 21
arrived at 21 30 9 30pm and were met by the friendly reception staff
arrived at 9pm on a saturday and we didn t see one staff member
arrived early and the staff informed that the room will be ready at 2pm and he will call
arrived to be greeted by receptionist who couldn t speak any english
arrived yesterday love the kiddi pool for a quick splash
as a family travelling with young children i would recommend the location
as a guest of the hostel you are also allowed to chill at the sister resort manta pavilion s pool
as a more professional staff would
as are all the staff
as far as location goes
as i booked the overnight lake tour with sunny from jungle which is the tourist office from this place
as i said above this place is cheap and out of the way from the hustle and bustle of patong
as it is right in the center of the nightlife and a walk to the beach
as it overlooked the beachfront and was often quiet we visited in the busy season
as mentioned by previous guests the place looks fantastic
as other people have stated
as others have said short walk from airport using sky bridge
as quoted by many travelers the place needs a total refurb
as shown in photos but they are clean and the prices are ok
as some people mentioned the space in the room is quite limited
as soon as we arrived i knew it was not the place for us i did not even want to see our room
as the hotel inn dont have adjoining room but they place us adjacent to each other
as the other hotels are not as nice beach
as the place was quite new
as the view from the room is as well as in the morning as in the evening to watch the sunset a dream
as we have booked 4 nights to relax in the beautiful koh tao
as well as being a result this place has a bar and restaurant open to non residents
as well as building sites the rooms we had were on a very busy road with lots of idiots on bikes
as well he knows a place where you can rent a good bike
aside from the view of the riverfront
ask for room to the street
at a bargain price for a simple bungalow on the beach
at least in garden view bungalows
at patong beach
at sleep walk hostel is so good location
at the first look room seemed clean and allright
at the first night we were a bit discouraged by the steep hill we had to walk up
at the risk of sounding arrogant
at the same time very good location
at this point in our trip we preferred a vibrant location rather than a resort styled property
attentive staff
attentive without being intrusive and great fun around the pool
average beds and the bathrooms could be better but in general it was not a bad

beach and shops with the free shuttle bus
beach clean and cleaned daily

bee the receptionist insisted that our booking was for 2 guest only
been there for just 3 nights and this place is stunning
before beginning my long list of problems with this place
behavior and service both were disgusting
behind the bus station and between the shopping malls blue port and market place
being a 5 star hotel and especially when it comes to club lounge service this hotel must do better
being clise to the local market eating places and departmental store made our good area
being outside of the town of lamai enables one to enjoy a less hectic environment
being practically on the beach
being right on the beach you cannot beat the price
being so close to many eateries and main roads
being so close to the shops
being there in the off season it is a wonderful and peaceful place

bus station and bts station is just 2mins walking away
but a bit outside the main areas of the city
but a quiet place to stay and convenient
but absolutely worth its price 1 very good cleanliness of bathrooms and rooms
but after spending the night and traveling out into the confusion and traffic and urban cacofany
but after u stay there a few hours it is very relaxing
but also near by the street
but at first sight of the place i was pleased
but bts sky train is only a few steps from hotel entrance
but clean
but clean and the bed was surprisingly comfy
but clean and well kept
but clean and with aircon
but close to airport for early morning flight 10 mins
but close to delicious places to eat in a great neighbourhood
but comfortable
but decided to come to patong to experience bangla road for my partners 50th birthday
but decided to stay another night as 1 day would not do justice to this place
but dmk ariport its clean also
but first the location is odd
but from our experience the firsts hotel that very dirty and not clean
but good comfortable stay
but had problem with staff not friendly
but hidden in a quiet neighborhood
but honestly there are hotels guesthouses that are in town
but i always miss this place
but i booked with the belief that i could hangout on a rooftop to read and chill when i wanted to rest
but i d still expect everything to be clean
but i felt so disappointed with one of the receptionist short hair lady who is middle age with specs
but i had a great experience at tanee place
but i noticed that the hotel location is a bit far from central area and quite isolated
but i really want to recommend it this place to eat
but i think the reason for this is the location
but if you are the person who looking for the peaceful place here is the right place for you
but if you re looking for a peaceful quiet place and budgeted this is it
but if you want to get a taste of local expat life
but if you want to relax with your loved ones without
but if you want to stay somewhere safe and clean i d avoid starlight like the plague
but in a great position in the city
but in fariness if you arent and who would pick here if you were its a good place to be
but is clean and tidy
but is still close to convenient stores
but it did have a pool
but it is a peaceful place to rest
but it is cheap and clean
but it is clean
but it is so noisy in the street
but it really is very comfortable here
but it really worth it if you want to relax and live with the sun tythm the sound of the sea
but it turns out it is gone there is only an empty space on the beach left
but it was actually very quiet and peaceful
but it was close to everything i need to go to
but it was immaculately clean
but it works especially in this heat food options around the hotel are good less than a minute s walk
but its still 2 minutes to the area where everything happens staff is great
but its view is not that good due to its height
but location of hostel is the problem
but most important there is a super good atmosfeer with super helpfull friendly staff
but mostly chocked by the state of the building and the rooms
but my friend and i could easily walk from ramkhamhaeng mrt station to the hotel using the gps
but near a supermarket and mall
but not really clean either
but not the bathroom
but nowhere was that stated when i made the booked
but once i slept threw my first night i realized this was not the place that it seemed to be
but only 3 into town with uber x loved it
but other resorts nearby had the same size beach as a year ago
but overall its an excellent place to stay
but overall the room is good and the staff very helpul
but quiet it s a perfect place to get away
but reception staff non cooperative
but rooms are clean
but served its purpose
but small place for henging clouts
but sometimes you arrive at a place that feels good
but staff service is a bit unsatisfactory especially receptionist need improvement in english
but staff take wrong order and serve a wrong drink
but still be able to have a peaceful nights sleep
but still located fine
but still near the markets and restaurants
but sukhuthai hotel is right in the city that give u a relaxing and out of city feeling
but that also provides for bigger bedrooms
but that place was alongside a noisy road with the perfume of diesel and septic wafting around
but the beds are comfortable and the rooms are warm
but the experience was very relaxing
but the family who run the place were very helpful couldn t do enuf for us
but the features make this place an absolute must stay
but the hotel offers a shuttle service that will take you wherever you want to go and also
but the lane next to it is a night life hot spot
but the location right on the beach with 3 pools looking over the sea is just so lovely
but the most enjoyable place in the bungalow was the good size
but the nearby places but only thai food
but the office staff rude
but the place is a dump
but the place is full of charm
but the place is so peaceful and everyone is super helpful with everything
but the place itself isnt very nice
but the place was quite nice
but the place was very neglected
but the pool is good and the service superb
but the receptionist a gave me a room directly above the bar and
but the room was not very clean
but the room was surprisingly clean and comfortable
but the service is not good
but the staff was so nice when i rented a bycicle that i thought they deserved a review
but the staff were really trying to fix the problem
but the standards of the place were practically insulting
but the sun is not shining in to the pool area
but the view from the balcony was a cement wall
but the view from the restaurant is wonderful located right on the beach
but the view from the windows is into the basement parking garage
but then again the service is great
but then they gave me a room in any cheap neighborhood guesthouse
but there are some good ones nearby
but there is a very interesting night street food market a few minutes away that pops up every evening
but there will always be someone to drive you there and pick you up when you are ready to come back
but they had a free shuttle service and bikes that you can borrow
but they were busy
but this place is going to be an exception
but this place is just ok
but this place is so bad it s unreal
but this staircase is worth a good view you have in your room besudes
but this time i was driving past and the resort looked great from the outside
but this was the worst place ever
but to all our surprise the hotel room was jus worth the proce we booked at and the facility was
but to get served and seated
but unfortunately i found 2 small cockroaches in my bedroom
but very close to sat night market
but very convenient for access to pier
but was clean with nice bathroom
but was glad that the aircon did work ok
but we came everyday to have a drink or a snack to this wonderful place
but we did not knew we will be place at the top floor of the building
but when you are there it is obvious the place is not taken care of very well at all
but worth it for the price and location
buy food from outside and cook in the apartment since no convenient store and restaurant around the area
by far an awful place that i ve stayed in phuket
by staying in a small place like this means
cable tv and plenty of space
calm absolutely fantastic place
calm area in spite of being on the main road
calm peaceful and quite
can definitely recommend that place
can find all activities nearby
can recommend this place highly we had a great fortnight
can sit and people watch on the street
can t recommend this place enough
can t recommend this place more
can walk to chinatown and night bazaar
cannot recommend this hotel enough for the cleanliness of the rooms and the friendliness of the staff
car park also available and easy to find
carpe diem residence is a must visit place if you ever visit koh pha ngan especially for the first time

child friendly for those looking for a place when travelling to bangkok yet want to be near everything

delicious very close to a peaceful beach
demanded 1000 bhat to clean a towel

despite being a bit run down and the room especially bathroom being small with a faint odor of dampness
despite it being close to the park and forrest
despite the great location if you re looking to stay in the center of phi phi and amazing view
despite this we found the hotel to be very quiet and comfortable
dharasom is an affordable place with great friendly services
did not get to interact with the staff a lot but when i needed the front desk
did not seem like a place for sozializing though
did not stay here as i did not know about the place
different type of place right on the beach
difficult decision to rate this little gem or not
difficult staff receptionist would not give an early check in even though room was available
dining and relax

do take privilege of having massage at the shop located adjacent to the hotel lobby
don muang hotel is very near from don muang airport

dotted around the central pool
down a long driveway and about 200m from surin beach
down a steep hill so unless very capable of walking it will be a struggle only up side was the beach area
down a very pretty side street
down an unassuming back street off the main road to the beach
drawers in bedroom were filthy and not clean up after the last guest left
drinks great and staff prompt
due in no small part to the lack of good ventilation in the bathrooms
due to big room size and aircon is a bit further from bed
due to rough sea conditions the ferry boats were suspended on the day is was schedualed to arrive
during a day more noise thanks to traffic
during our time in thailand we decide to spend time in this place

each member of the staff were very kind and were willing to help with everything we needed

smith residence has been my go to place in chiang mai for 8 years
snorkeling places and views
so are the staff and general facilities
so business hall also was good located and fine at second floor
so chilled out with the most fantastic beach
so clean and comfortable
so clean and cosy
so clean rooms
so close to everything
so close to everything but at the same time very quiet area
so close to everything cheap to get everywhere around the island if you can t ride a bike
so close to the old city and yet when you arrive here you feel like you are in a peaceful sanctuary
so comfortable
so comments about the bar may not apply in her new location
so first off i will say the rooms here are really nice and beds comfortable which was a good thing
so for the sake of future travelers i am going to give a honest review of the place
so friendly staff
so great value and clean
so having a clean and comfortable hotel for my returning customers right over the road is ideal
so here you are at the hotel which has amazing location
so i booked a night at this place having a confirmation from booking
so i chose this place and absolutely glad i found it stayed for few times
so i chose to stay at this inexpensive hotel near his dormitory
so i had to stay in this hotel due to it s proximity to my work place in bangkok
so i stopped to come and found other better hotels in the city
so if you re not looking for peace and quiet this is not the right place for you
so its away from city chores as a result relaxation gets to the next level of vacation
so its is not a good place for familys with children
so kind and helpful the pool area is really nice and the room was big and very cleaned
so many bkk hotels should take a lesson from this place
so many good things to say about this place
so me and my wife booked this place for 8 nights
so much of we wanted to see in chiangmai was within walking distance
so near to kfc
so nice view
so no privacy on the loo toiletries provided and the rooftop pool was a nice touch albeit rather
so relaxing and not too many people
so that means you are virtually near to everything
so the hotel was quiet and i had the balcony with beautiful view to the ocean all to myself
so the location seemed perfect
so they would not have to deal with the horrific early morning traffic woes
so this older property is a far more economical option in this neighborhood
so we choose this place mostly because of the views
so we didn t want anything special as we would be in the city all day long anyways
so we had to take the motorcycle taxis everytime fr bts to hotel cost 20bhat
so we walked around the hotel grounds and then took a taxi to the beach area
so we wanted to visit her and check out the beach while it might be out of the way for some
so we went back to the beach and got a table at the thai
so we were a little disappointed by the place and the bungalows when we arrived
so we were ready for a beach holiday
so when the touts at the airport offered me this place
so you are in the center but feel outside the town
so you would need a reason for the location
sofa area nice addition and a huge bathroom with both bath tub and shower seperate
soft towels and clean sheets
solid staff
some do have sea view
some friends arrange a trip to this resort off season so we had the whole place to ourselves
some staff have limited english to
somehow our room was clean

what we did like the location
what we did not know is that the hotel did not have the credit card facilities

which included a tv and comfortable bed
which is a great location and like 3 minutes walk to the beach
which is a local shopping area air conditioned
which is a quiet area and near to the only green space in the old town
which is basic but clean
which is easy to hang out the old city and enjoy the local life style
which is located in the city center of surat thani
which is perfect for relaxing and feeling that you are the only one in this paradise
which is ridiculous that the cleaning service is more expensive then one day of rent

yet all facilities are good and stuffs were helpful
yet it is not on the main street so not too loud
yet it is walking distance if you had a few
yet nestled on a hill where it was very quiet and peaceful
yet somehow it lacks the wow factor because it is all narrow with no view or charm
yet still walking distance to many of the key tourist sights and koh san road area
