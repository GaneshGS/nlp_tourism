but being 60 years old it was on my bucket list of must do s pretty nervous really what a way to be introduced to what lies under the ocean two 12m dives within a few,NatureTravel,0
but big enough the central department store is full of sparkle and eye candy prices a bit high there are many restaurants all this is refreshing however,ShoppingTravel,1
but bob s was by the far the best shop and it was not even close in reality,ShoppingTravel,1
but david was very patient and took me to the beach so we could,NatureTravel,0
but deffinetly worth it wear proper shoes and bring lots off water with you,ShoppingTravel,1
but definitely worth it either take mrt till phahonyothin or directly a taxi using the tollway the owner has assembled a compound of old teak houses he bought in the provinces and recreated a,ShoppingTravel,1
but definitely worth visiting one hour walk and you get the idea of mangrove forest good wooden path great tower to watch sights small crabs everywhere no fee,NatureTravel,0
but despite that i think it was a great beach not as popular as patong beach,NatureTravel,0
but discovered the temple is beautiful which covers several floors that,NatureTravel,0
but entrance to the market includes a boat ride around all most,ShoppingTravel,1

but i guess wuith friends in very high places you can get away with anything it is an absolutely beautiful beach,NatureTravel,0
but i had a great time there in the holidays there was nature everywhere,NatureTravel,0
but i have to say that the night market was a sad experience it was dirty,ShoppingTravel,1
but i might have gone a bit early reached there at 6pm and there could not have been more that 10 customers in that park the rides look fun,NatureTravel,0
but i personally found it quite average the temple dates back around 400 years,NatureTravel,0
but i was prepared by taking tablet for sea sickness the cost of tour was thb 2800 for adult i liked that,NatureTravel,0
but i would like to talk about lunch and shopping the all seasons place is a great place for both affordable lunch at the food courts,ShoppingTravel,1
but if you are looking for a great market,ShoppingTravel,1
but if you come by bike they make you park really far away all the fancy fancy cars can park at the door but cant offer one spot to motorbikes the mall it is self is a small open air type,NatureTravel,0
but instructor tom gave us all the tools to learn how to fly he s very patient i certainly was not a natural and it s a low stress,NatureTravel,0
but is probably one of the most beautiful of the island in general there are not so many people,NatureTravel,0
but is relatively upmarket good place for shopping,ShoppingTravel,1
but it has the feeling of a quiet oasis these days it s difficult for any bkk high end shopping mall to distinguish itself gaysorn suffers a bit from this challenge however,ShoppingTravel,1
but it is a very pretty and scenic temple the temple also has a multitude of statues of buddha which are fascinating the main building is very calm and tranquil,NatureTravel,0
but it is all takeaway hardly any seating it is an authentic thai night market,ShoppingTravel,1
but it is quite beautiful do take drinking water if you head into the trail ways good walking shoes are a must flip flops are not a good idea,ShoppingTravel,1
but it s worth it beautiful views,NatureTravel,0
but it was nevertheless a gorgeous little beach,NatureTravel,0
but it was quite a boat trip almost two hours by speedboat but not too bad as long as you are not prone to sea sickness,NatureTravel,0
but johnny made shirts from his measurements when we returned home,ShoppingTravel,1
but knew nothing about the various companies we learned of sea bees through our hotel,NatureTravel,0
but looks more like the souvenirshop in a themepark the usual touristic t shirts,ShoppingTravel,1
but lots of plastic garbage is under the trees bring shoes for swimming,ShoppingTravel,1
but may be one of the best tailors in bangkok i have used them and others for years and put quite a shilling there the quality of the work has always been to high standards and a few special garments they made for me,ShoppingTravel,1
but mr armon guide me which is the best suit for me made 3 shirts and 1 suit it is very funtastic birthday present for me,ShoppingTravel,1
but newman had left me with a sour taste after getting 3 shirts and 2 pants made there there was an indian staff who was rather unfriendly and just shoved the clothes up in front of,ShoppingTravel,1
but no snorkeling beach clean beach,NatureTravel,0
but not great either close to central world easy 10 minute walk bars are in the back of the market and numerous food stalls in the center area the 3 or 4 biggest all seemed to have the same menu but decent selection,ShoppingTravel,1
but not here we had a great time with the elephants,NatureTravel,0
but not so fantastic if you are looking to do some shopping go to mbk,ShoppingTravel,1
but not sure why this is called  grand  for a start it actually has no central department store,ShoppingTravel,1
but not too challenging restaurant pro shop is ok bring your own clubs as rental clubs are old especially for ladies,ShoppingTravel,1
but nothing nauseating some great views of,NatureTravel,0
but now it rivals khao san road as one of the more densely populated tourist haunts in the city we visited during the day when the street was peaceful and,NatureTravel,0
but only 10 minutes by taxi from mo chit bts if you want to see a market in bangkok which is not a tourist market but a place where thai people come to eat and shop,ShoppingTravel,1
but only if you are in this area as all temples in bangkok are wonderful,NatureTravel,0
but otherwise nothing floats just another bargaining market,ShoppingTravel,1
but our captain bob was funny and our guide knowledgeable alex paddled our kayak with some skill as was high tide in the caves he pointed out lots of interesting cave,NatureTravel,0
but our guide skipped over one of the temples unfortunately maybe due to time overall though it was very nice they picked us up and transported between places,NatureTravel,0
but paul and his team made the whole thing easy comfortable to reach phi phi island by speed boat,NatureTravel,0
but pulled into the car park and saw a sign that said 250m walk to the waterfall after the arduous walk to waterfall,NatureTravel,0

but the road is not too good the view is okay,NatureTravel,0
but the safety level seemed high and i had a great experience 1 dive from the bay and 2 from a boat with them i felt very safe,NatureTravel,0

but the stalls are great a lot of clothes though but the stall holders are really nice and you don t have to bater a lot we got really ripped off with the price of our taxi,ShoppingTravel,1
but the style is exuberent and traditional the temple has a lot of nice detail and you can walk up to the top of,NatureTravel,0
but the temple is open,NatureTravel,0
but the top of the temple is not the same copy always like this it is just copy from khmer nowadays like chinese park has copies from angkor thom too,NatureTravel,0
but the vegetarian food court had closed a couple months ago still some other related businesses seem to be open,ShoppingTravel,1
but the view is really fantastic we saw the big buddha and went up to the top they have a nice family or individual blessing ceremony by a monk that s worth doing we donated a little money afterward i think,NatureTravel,0
but the view is well worth it i saw people in flip flops but i would recommend something with more traction,NatureTravel,0
but the view is worth it but keep in mind,NatureTravel,0
but then i met pk they took the time and gave me perfect advise the suits and blouses were perfectly tailor made when i,ShoppingTravel,1
but then i walked into martin s tailor alex made the entire experience a breeze very professional in his approach,ShoppingTravel,1
but there is a nonstop sentimental song playing on loud speakers rather than being able to hear the birds and enjoy nature i found myself looking forward to getting away from the annoying music i would not go back or,NatureTravel,0
but there is a shop in ao nang collected on time from hotel for short drive to beach to catch a longtail to the dive boat nice,ShoppingTravel,1
but there is way to many tourists on the island which is a shame the island are so beautiful,NatureTravel,0
but they have free shuttle bus from nearby mrt station,ShoppingTravel,1
but they took me to a crocodile farm,NatureTravel,0
but they were enough to provide the dozen or so visitors a first hand experience in elephant grooming and feeding the introductory lecture delivered by the owner was too long,NatureTravel,0
but think that i was treated well at a fair price i had a jacket made and 8 9 shirts of which all are cut well and the workmanship seems better than my last tailor,ShoppingTravel,1
