and also did two courses there open water and advanced open water since they were called sunshine divers would highly recommend as they are closely affiliated with bans divers one of the largest on the island and
and at the temple nui did a
and came back this trip to see how renovations were progressing the wat has become more popular there was several tourist vans and cars there taking up the very limited parking more visitors
and camera with waterproof covering amazing corals and sea creatures
and can go up and onto the roof for views
and comprehensive briefing by steve before each dive i hope to
and concerned with safety just the jungle scenery was amazing and the rapids were challenging i would certainly recommend doing it
and conveniently close to bangkok island beach of koh samet this location is clean
and dive ned is amazing he is an incredible diver and fantastic teacher he is extremely knowledgeable and very patient out of the water ned is friendly
and elephant pictures the monkey show is 10 minutes i have seen the show before in phuket
and even if in 17 dives i did not see any whale shark
and even though black mountain is cheaper less than half price than ava it was much funner for the kids from the market village there is a free shuttle bus to the water
and even went diving in the sea
and explaining many things about temples in chiang mai nasi was one of the best tour guides i have ever met
and finally on richelieu rock thailand s number 1 dive site our tour guide
and fish spa it looked great on paper but was not the elephants do not look like they are treated well chained and made to do tricks atv
and forecast to rain heavily it did and it just made the day even better we did tour d4 a walking and feeding with elephants
and from then i was hooked i did a couple fun dives with jibi
and great we visit the limestone rock paddle canoe in the amazing cave
and have a trip to the local dive area around phi phi thank s to a

and having dived at dozens of dive centers in 13 countries
and he showed us round the local dive sites perfectly bida nok
and he took us to a beautiful elephant sanctuary
and he was nothing less than amazing he was very passionate about the care for each elephant he made sure that every participant knew about the elephants and engaged in a healthy way with the elephants before we fed and
and headed to the departure point erawan waterfall was the highlight of the tour 7 levels of waterfalls
and hearty breakfast with an abundance of home cooked food everyone was friendly and easy to talk to the toilet is in a cave
and housed one of the largest standing buddha in town weekend can be busy with more thais worshippers and tourist at the same
and how to take care of elephants and how to know if an elephant is healthy and happy the rides are amazing and they explained us that elephants
and i did not notice any scars or signs of abuse of the elephants which is a major concern for some
and i had a fantastic experience on our karen tribe elephant experience we truly got to know the elephants we worked with the karen tribe team are very kind to the elephants in their care we got to feed
and i had a terrible experience i asked for an english speaking dive
and i was amazed at how much coral and sea life actually glows we saw scorpion fish
and i will definitely consider eco dive resort as the most valuable choice the crew is really really awesome nathyn fon have always tried their best to make everything comfortable for
and in a comfy mini bus it took about an hr to get to the pier the team was friendly and showed confidence in their skill and knowledge of the sea caves making the canoeing experience
and it is still great i just wanted to add that as of april 2019 the pier that used to have all the fishing boats is under repair so the lively atmosphere is not so great at the moment hopefully
and it was a lovely gentle experience first we went for a short ride on the elephants through the gorgeous bush land
and it was beautiful it was so empty and quiet it was a slice of paradise only thing to note is don t drive down the entrance in a car as the car park is sized
and lunch the beach has a lot of rocks so i suggest swim shoes otherwise
and made sure we were comfortable and prepared before heading into the water the first part of our discover scuba dive involved practicing
and makes sure you get to try everything that is unique to the island he looked after us well we went kayaking
and mojo divers was recommended to me by the staff of one of the hostels i stayed at some fun dives became roughly 20 as the vibe
and nice for walking it was not a very busy beach
and night dives have always fascinated me
and once for a full day tour to hong island the service is decent the boats are well maintained
and only local dive due to weatherforcast he explained in all his honnestly the pro s and cons with
and other various plastics and junk it is amazing to see the amount of misinformation there is online about holiday places freedom beach is
and really go out of their way to give you an amazing experience we saw such beautiful places and really enjoyed the snorkelling and visit to monkey beach special shout out to
and rode them bareback i don t like the seats i think they hurt the elephants the elephant lifted
and saladan pier is a great way of doing precisely that we lived at long beach so it took a short
and sasa gave the perfect amount of information at the temples highly recommend
and temples from another angle highly suggested
and thailand now allow no smoking on any beach
and the boat itself was fine and super places taken to hong island and the lagoon are stunning
and the dive point so beautiful thank you so much
and the guide ford spoke english well we did the half day tour in rainy conditions and it was fabulous elephants were well taken care of
and the park is next to a lovely lake you do not have to be into
and the people were super friendly the elephants appeared to be happy and well kept
and the sikh temple is fascinating there are so many contrasts in bangkok
and the staff were friendly and helpful we were able to feed the elephants both bamboo and sugar cane
and the two famous sights hard to see the grandmother rock but it was worth the visit to see this natural attraction
and the views from the top of the road were divine this beach is clean and sleepy there seemed to be more grit when walking along the beach compared to the other beaches on this
and then as dive guide intern for the rest of the season with them what an amazing experience as a lifelong diver
and then sam was an exceptional guide the day of seeing the waterfalls
and there was complimentary return van shuttle to river city special mention to khun wipada for her details during reservation
and they know so much about all the dive operations
and this ride gave me a beautiful view of the countryside
and this time in bangkok i just want to do one thing meditate in one of the temple pariwat temple just happened near to my hotel pariwat temple is located in one of bangkok s southern suburbs
and very caring all of the instructors are highly professional and super friendly too it is one of the busiest dive schools in koh tao
and we are so glad they did we had a very personal experience with the elephants and you can tell they are taken care of very well the staff was impeccable they really made the experience so
and we had 4 amazing dives at this paradise they have as their frontyard
and we had a really nice day snorkeling nice spot for lunch at the beach
and we have seen about 8 of them the architecture sets it aside with a great view from the top close to the grand palace and khao san road area
and we were the only people there at the time the elephants are well cared for
and you get a great experience we first fed the three elephants
and you think  oh this will be a nice gentle ride down the river  right well

another very well looked after temple the site has many buildings and a must do is the walk around the shrine as you walk around the building you hit the bells as you pass bye thsi is a very nice place to visit
anyway the guide can choose different paths if you re not too fit wonderful landscapes
ao nang beach is along 1 km long and quite clean there are many restaurants and massage centers along the beach side water is not vivid blue as near the islands but warm and clean enough to swim there are no water activities like banana
ao nang is a great town but they have to address the issue of safe access to the beaches the best beaches require you to use the service of the longtail boat service for access we went to phra nang cave beach at other day

as temples in bangkok make you pay to rent one the temple is tiny and in need of some tlc the monk was asleep inside the view

bloomberg news reported 18 may 2016 tachai island to close indefinitely due to excessive damage environment very sad but necessary
blue lagoon emerald lake ko mae ko lake in ang thong marine national park

boat crews and my dive guides nadia and toon
boat sometimes too crowded especially high season because it s shared with other dive operators however
boat was in very good condition and the destination was spectacular we had a great time kayaking at hong island

booked this hotel to have a nice and relaxing beach vacation on phi phi when checking in we were informed that the pool was closed for renovation until late november genius idea
booked through tom fisherman s villas it s our second stay snorkelling trip but to be able to accomodate a mixed group of newbies and snorkelling plus varying levels of divers was absolutely perfect the boat was comfortable
booze etc need a few more branches around the island
both ludo and patrick are really excellent professional and can organize any diving trip you want i did 3 days and 9 dives to different sites and can highly recommend them for all prices are
bottom line do not ever go on a dive trip with this operation details as to why they showed up to pick us up an hour late when we finally got on the dive boat
brave the twists and turns of the road as it is well worth it make sure you look around as there are a few temples and a monument commemorating the chinese soldiers and families who settled in doi mae salong there are also tea plantations
breath taking come at 11 am like i did so it s not as crowded around 3 4 pm the beach fills up so taking unique pictures gets harder loved my stay here and couldn t recommend more to anyone to take this trip worth it totally
breathtaking views from the top worth the 20mins trek we were just 6 pax on the beach at the time do brings you drinks down with as no bar resto down dont forget to bring them back with you afterwards good swim but not so good

but a beautiful drive on a crooked mountain side road to get there old style thai homes on a 3 or 4 block long stretch along the sea on the east side of lanta the shops are full of t shirts
but also a great view of the city my girl refused
but at the end it was an enjoyable experience a man made island at the shore of the river
but being 60 years old it was on my bucket list of must do s pretty nervous really what a way to be introduced to what lies under the ocean two 12m dives within a few
but david was very patient and took me to the beach so we could
but definitely worth visiting one hour walk and you get the idea of mangrove forest good wooden path great tower to watch sights small crabs everywhere no fee
but despite that i think it was a great beach not as popular as patong beach
but discovered the temple is beautiful which covers several floors that
but failed to point out where coral was for snorkelling leaving many guests frustrated at poor snorkelling food was very good at lunch time but so overcrowded
but feel peace and nice visiting this temple
but had dealings with gustavo in respect of some dive equipment a new bcd that needed parts changing our communication was solely over the phone or via video call despite not selling me the bcd gustavo went
but here there is also the opportunity to go on the roof where you can enjoy the amazing bangkok s view moreover at the top there is a bar and a nice skywalk i suggest walking on the glass
but his driving was wonderful our first stop was doi inthanon nation park
but i cannot we dove every dive on scandinavian diving center koh chang s boats
but i do not dive that much therefore
but i guess wuith friends in very high places you can get away with anything it is an absolutely beautiful beach
but i had a great time there in the holidays there was nature everywhere
but i might have gone a bit early reached there at 6pm and there could not have been more that 10 customers in that park the rides look fun
but i personally found it quite average the temple dates back around 400 years
but i was prepared by taking tablet for sea sickness the cost of tour was thb 2800 for adult i liked that
but if you come by bike they make you park really far away all the fancy fancy cars can park at the door but cant offer one spot to motorbikes the mall it is self is a small open air type
but instructor tom gave us all the tools to learn how to fly he s very patient i certainly was not a natural and it s a low stress
but is probably one of the most beautiful of the island in general there are not so many people
but it is a very pretty and scenic temple the temple also has a multitude of statues of buddha which are fascinating the main building is very calm and tranquil
but it s worth it beautiful views
but it was nevertheless a gorgeous little beach
but it was quite a boat trip almost two hours by speedboat but not too bad as long as you are not prone to sea sickness
but knew nothing about the various companies we learned of sea bees through our hotel
but no snorkeling beach clean beach
but not here we had a great time with the elephants
but nothing nauseating some great views of
but only if you are in this area as all temples in bangkok are wonderful
but our captain bob was funny and our guide knowledgeable alex paddled our kayak with some skill as was high tide in the caves he pointed out lots of interesting cave
but our guide skipped over one of the temples unfortunately maybe due to time overall though it was very nice they picked us up and transported between places
but paul and his team made the whole thing easy comfortable to reach phi phi island by speed boat
but pulled into the car park and saw a sign that said 250m walk to the waterfall after the arduous walk to waterfall
but quite refreshing for chinese style colourful and climpse of sea so worth a visit since its free and there is not so much to see in the island
but the access pontoon to hong island lurched up and down with the waves and people on it like afunfair big
but the best temple with good view
but the children absolutely loved it if you are looking for a hotel right on the beach there are several opportunities here where you can
but the driver picked us up and guided us to the pier our boat had a deck and we were seated there for a good view buffet
but the entire day felt like we were in a postcard every island spot was literal heaven
but the first two had lovely snorkelling spots
but the fourth wall is formed by the river mekong
but the remaning was a disaster arriving at either island no 4
but the road gets more dangerous year by year better go there by car it is some kms south of hua hin beach is wonderful and due to location not so crowded during week avoid it at weekends
but the road is not too good the view is okay
but the safety level seemed high and i had a great experience 1 dive from the bay and 2 from a boat with them i felt very safe
but the sands are golden and the views breathtaking take a closer look though and at high tide in particular the true
but the staff was super helpful and they made me feel safe in the water many dives in a day so you really see a lot very good thai food
but the style is exuberent and traditional the temple has a lot of nice detail and you can walk up to the top of
but the temple is open
but the top of the temple is not the same copy always like this it is just copy from khmer nowadays like chinese park has copies from angkor thom too
but the view is really fantastic we saw the big buddha and went up to the top they have a nice family or individual blessing ceremony by a monk that s worth doing we donated a little money afterward i think
but the view is well worth it i saw people in flip flops but i would recommend something with more traction
but the view is worth it but keep in mind
but there is a nonstop sentimental song playing on loud speakers rather than being able to hear the birds and enjoy nature i found myself looking forward to getting away from the annoying music i would not go back or
but there is way to many tourists on the island which is a shame the island are so beautiful
but they took me to a crocodile farm
but they were enough to provide the dozen or so visitors a first hand experience in elephant grooming and feeding the introductory lecture delivered by the owner was too long
but this is my favorite beach in koh phangan
but this time i climbed to the top of the hill there were a small temple and a fantastic view towards bang saen beach on one side and towards ang sila on the other there were fewer monkeys than i
but to me they were really nice i did suffer a bit of an ear damage on my very first dive
but visited the snake farm as my oh wanted to go paid quite a lot of money
but was quickly sorted out we visited some view points south of patong and phuket city
but was shocked to see tourist riding elephants on the roads in 38 degree heat how can our species be this stupid
but we had trouble to find a good start location where we could rent a long tail boat finally a local person helped us mekhala river cruise pier
but we have never gone to the beach due to the distance reading great reviews on social media
but well worth the climb the views of the city are wonderful and given
but what best are the cafes which are terraced right on the beach one can have a meal or a drink while enjoying the atmosphere you can even laze or swim at the pool and enjoy the day with
but when it comes to interior and atmosphere wat mangkon is actually far more impressive to avoid the crowds of nearby
but wished we did resorts accommodation were right on the beach
but with so much coming and going from the island
but you can swim you are longer in the car then you can enjoy the waterfall or emerald pool
by accident we learnt that you could go elephant bathing close to khao lak we found a taxi driver and asked him to take us there early afternoon the place is located about 15 minutes drive outside the town where they have 3 young elephants
by far my favourite temple i have been to in a while the red clay is something different and the architecture and detail is insane would recommend but you cannot spend very long here the heat will get you
by far some of the most amazing sophisticated yet cool and fresh island wear amazing men collection
by far the best beach for swimming and relaxing on far less rubbish and washed up debris than the other beaches monsoon low season though so im guessing high season has more cleanup happening
by far the best tour ever for the price for the phi phi island
by far the worst dive school i ever dived with most of the equipment was old and damaged the pressure gauge information console of my buddy stopped working at 30m depth the owner did not take this problem seriously at all in addition to
calm relaxing tour to experience meeting elephants in their natural environment
calm sea
came across this beautiful church on our way back from the waterfalls the church has some fine artifacts and interior father roman is a very good religious guy and knows phuket very well suggested some good places to visit
came back for the jungle tour first tour was the city tour experienced guides
came here as a part of a booked tour from mintita travels this was our second stop for the day post the visit to karon view point the place is not well maintained
came here july doing the hike from sairee beach nice walk from sairee to mae haad was 30 min but tons of shops so you will not be bored then you hit mae haad take a break and grab a bubble tea or fruit shake or
came to ayutthaya to see the temples
came to this beach with a day tour that visits racha yai iand and this banana besch this is a nice and clean beach with fluffy sand not too busy and one of the best snorkeling spots with lots of fish in clear water perfect
camping place at the foot of mountain
can be viewed as another temple in bangkok city
can be viewed from a boat only looks just like any other island in the area beach looks very nice but tourists are not alowed to go ashore
can t commend iq highly enough bjorn and natt as our guides today were highly knowledgeable 18m dredger wreck dive just what we wanted a morning activity being divers since 2012 but only doing this on holiday they were patient and kind especially for my
can t speak highly enough about in to the wild elephant camp i spent ages researching ethical elephant sanctuaries and comparing and decided on this one because of the reviews and the fact that they support the local community around them it was fantastic
cannot believe bangkok has soooo many nice cafe i like the bloc because it is built with different containers with a good view too it is a bit hard to get there
cant say thank you enough to the sea turtle divers team
care for and look after the poor elephants that have been bought up in the cruel tourist trades these elephants are
caught a bath bus from white sand beach to klong plu waterfall paid 200bht per person for entry into national park a twenty minute walk to reach the waterfall stunning waterfall the volume of water coming down was huge it had rained quite heavy during
cave chamber is huge after crawled through an small aperture entrance access is easy with wooden stair case with hand rail allocate 3 hours or more to appreciate the nature wonder powerful headlamp is a must as part of the cave is huge and
cave tour and canoeing
cave with painting about 3
certainly recommend visiting this area short boat trip from sairee beach or you will stop on the way if you do a snorkelling trip the sand beach itself is strewn with dead pieces of coral so barefoot approach to the water is very uncomfortable
chai chet is a small place but the beach is really nice not to busy clean and peaceful we had a week here
chai took us on the most wonderful experience of our lives the guide was very knowledgeable about the entire area and you can tell they really love the elephants like family the hike was beautiful
chained up with no water or shade i presume they were taken across the road for the tourists to  ride  and swim but the actual elephant camp looked atrocious
challenging island hoping due to strong winds
challenging with some great views i would recommend this course to anyone if you
chandra was a surprise find in surin beach gorgeous designer clothes and accessories i picked up a lovely summer dress which will be my go to party dress this season and a unique necklace with a black lava stone they even threw in a gwp of
chartered a private longtail from 1pm to 5pm got there as the day tours were leaving we had the whole beach to ourselves for a couple hours the beach is worldclass outstanding bluest of water and whitest sand amazing
chatuchak park is a must see and is a short walk from chatuchak weekend market after spending time in the market
chaum beach nice for family
chaweng is big and nicest beach in samui should try beach at chawaeng south
chee chin khor is a chinese foundation that has been supporting the poor since 1952 there is a beautiful temple and a pagoda on their property
chiang saen is a nice old town there are many temples we visited temples here on the way back from the golden triangle to chiang rai good to visit
chiang saen provides a glimpse into traditional thai life and gives an understanding of the role of the mighty mekong in history we stayed at a lovely little place on the river and enjoyed watching the barges
chill and this beach served gooood food massage
choose the two day trekking at ethnice hill tribe eco trails we had a blast stumbling through parts of the jungle that few had crossed before our guide spoke english very well and told us loads of stories about thai
choosing the best dive center option in phuket is not easy i was lucky to find dive link and i would suggest it to everyone wanting to have an exclusive diving experience gus
cinema halls and a huge water park for the whole family but get very clear understanding before you enter the waterpark there is free train ride if
clarisse was amazing he completely take over all the responsibilities without tension she gives her best half day trip was excellent with snorkelling disappointed was will not seeing shark
clean and lovely sand on this beach the sea is warm but not deep making it ideal for children but if you are a keen swimmer you will have to go out a long way to get out of your depth lots of trees
clean and neat a great temple for people from all walks of life to worship the enlighten lord buddha
clean and new bus spacious and comfortable much nicer than taking sardine packed mini van wifi on the bus good view driving
clean beach crystal clear water lots of restaurant around big indian restaurant available too the water is not as blue green as shown in pictures
clean pathways and toilets being the major point where people take boats to the popular phi phi island
clean white sand beach there are many islands surrounding this beach vsitors can dive to see beautiful coral in this place
clear and clean sea
clear and shallow really great for small children several bars and places to eat along the beach surrounded by palm clad hills number of supermarket
clear colour beach
clear water need to walk out a long way at low tide to get any depth fabulous sunsets only downside is all the dope being smoked in the area but that is not the beach s fault
clearly koh lipe has become overly commercial in recent years the old places remain the same while the newer more expensive options are as nice as can be under the conditions a remote small island white sand paradise too many boats have all but completely
clever enough to have those kind of sea creature have an organisation together cool and nice place to see they are good on their bussines and education
climbing the mountain up and down to the cave
clocking up 11 dives around the surin islands
close to bangsak merlin resort lovely to walk along in the morning when only a few people are out nice clean beach used by the locals at the weekend picnic area and shade available eating places as well
close to ping river and pedestrian bridge
close to the banks of the chao phaya river the original temple
close to the river oasis of peace beautiful house in chineese style was touched by the time
clubs for hire not the best but course layout and view makes up for all that you must take a caddy 300baht plus tip but that
coco and his boat crew are some really nice people to go on a boat tour with around the phi phi islands they were both energetic and enthausiastic they also knew alot about the history behind the island they were very informative the boat was
coffee or water with biscuits then a quick informative guide as to our island tour
comfortable and fun to be on schedule and locations of individual dives were planned to fit the onboard guests  skills
compare to 15 years ago when i visited this island
compared to tien beach which is only a 5 minute walk away
comparing to previous years the beach has been much more quiet less tourists and the water was much more dirty i always loved this beach but due to low maintenance it is going in the wrong way
completed a great tour which took us to the farm stay on the way the guide kai was brilliant with the children keeping them going with lots of different activities i will not ruin the surprise just use these guys as they are excellent hosts our
constantly the place did not feel thai at all i tried to get a coffee across the buddha
cool beach without the hustle and bustle of white sands still a nice flat beach with clear warm waters nice beach front restaurants and beach bars on the south end
cool to visit and walk through however very crowded and hot agree with a few of the reviews here saying same old stuff for sale and it is really but we went to enjoy the atmosphere
coral dive
coral island is a beautiful small island
coral island with lunch
couldn t recommend rate higher as a group of three newbie divers we were anxious for our first discovery dive
couple of points you shoud consider booking a boat trip in ao nang and our experience with aonang speedboat tours 1 travel agents around the town are reselling same packages
couple or large group its very nice beach but not so good for sunbathing on the beach
course is always in nice condition always relaxed atmosphere
course was great as there was nobody else in my diving course i was lucky to get a private course steven was very friendly and a professional who is patient and explains well also the dive trips coast dives and boat dives were well
cr beach is a good place to chill
crew was great they make sure that everyone hv enough food onboard the boat breakfast at poda island wth the sunrise was stunning
crossing the river by boat ride and everything else excellent bikes even if your 2m
crowded beaches tons of tours drop off their passengers who walk around for an hour before going to the next island the snorkeling at chicken island should have
cruiser island resort is worth a visit
crystal clear water with soft golden sands to walk around unbeatable sunset scene really experience of a lifetime
currently here staying in andakira hotel tour booth is in the left lane when u leave hotel booked sightseeing trip to phuket great trip stopped at viewpoint

cutie happy elephants
dan was very helpful with explaining the locations of all the crags on the island he even offered to take us around and send with us we had an amazing time we rented some rope from him the crags are very nice on the island
dated back to the time when most poeple lived by the river or along the canals waterways were served as the main method of transportation in bangkok settlement which sprawled along the river banks and winding canals outside the city wall
dave and mike were incredible and made my experience the best it could be it was so easy booking everything with beachfront and it s even better once you get
dave was kind enough to accommodate me despite of short notice reservation the actual dive was made it easy fun and exciting by simon it has been 3 years since the
day trip to this beach
dear john awesome experience and your team of professional makes our little golf vacation an experience which we will cherish your recommendations on the golf courses were amazing and red mountain was really special thank you for your hospitality and professionalism

decided to stop by whilst bike riding thru the park today and was extremely disappointed i counted 3 or
deciding on a dive company on koh tao can be overwhelming with all the choices but you should t look any further than chic my partner and i completed the open water course with nick and we could not have asked for a better instructor nick
definitely going back i recommended all to dive with them to see
definitely going back to get another suit next time i am in ao nang have already recommended this place to a lot of my friends
definitely one of the best beach ware shops in chaweng koh samui not necessarily the cheapest but the quality and variety is good the shop assistant remembered us from prior years and was really helpful and accommodating am sure most ladies would find a suitable
definitely one of the best dive centers at ao nang krabi either as a begginer or qualified diver it is must local dive sites at domestic islands and dive sites at phi phi highly recommend
definitely worth a visit in the late evening when it is already dark you can see the lights over whole pattaya and the harbor all the lights of the ships and restaurant boats out on the sea lots of chinese tourists
delivers exactly what it promises comfortable spacious character boat with attentive and fun crew excellent food what a lovely way to enjoy this spectacular coastline and sunset paul is a superb boss on this cruise simon and julia ps beware of jellyfish
dense jungle and mountain streams lunch was so delicious
depending on where your beach resort is and what transport you have
despite being very close to the golden mountain temple
destination to banana beach koh hey and racha yai island the boat itself is very new and big
did 3 dives here and it was the most amazing thing to see every dive offered something differant happy to see the reefs
did a couple of dives at local islands
did a day dive with forra and had an amazing experience we were lucky to have an amazing encounter with a whaleshark but apart from the nature luck
did a half day kayak tour with fasai krabi tour to ao thalane bay picked up from hotel and picked up other guests along the way and it was about half an hour from aonang beach in a ute with the back converted to 2
did not have high expectations as this was beginning off season but sea was calm
did the half day started in mangrove forest boat ride to ghost island with climbing into eyes of skull then to monkey island for sea kayaking not too strenuous but through some cool caves and swam on nice beach then boat ride back with monkey
did this tour with my daughters and we absolutely loved it the trails were amazing and went on forever through lush green jungle i m used to running trails and couldn t help but respect these horses for their sure footing and strength on beautiful single track
did three dives with heart soul divers on a day trip out into the ocean i had booked at a 12 hour notice through a whatsapp message and did not pay anything until after the end of the trip i found that pretty intriguing
did turn up and arrive 40 mins late but got there no real apology or explanation just kept us waiting on the beach maybe i m expecting too much
didnt have a breefing or anything we got told that we were going on a wreck dive when we booked
dinner at this beach no can
dirty beach
dirty beach and nothing really special in the pagoda itself even the monks were so bored they did not even notice you
dirty beach littered
discovered this hike while reading what to do in krabi and around ao nang and i am so glad i did it was the highlight of my stay beautiful views
discovered this temple while looking for the ferry crossing back to the other side of chao praya river the temple is very popular with chinese and thai s with many tourists boats stopping
dive guide and cruise director on liveaboards in the similans rr is an amazing dive site
dive masters make you feel very comfortable underwater had a great time with simon arnolds as my dive master to complete my advanced adventurer program

do not book with coco dee bo tours booked a 5 island tour in koh chang and a jungle trip coco dee bo tours told me a price but i was forced to book an insurance on the pier
do not bother apart from the overcharging for farangs foreigners and the inability to access navy beaches in the area not a problem for airforce and army golf courses and beaches around hua hin this so called eco island is as another reviewer commented
do not feed any monkeys unless you are with the local the cost is thb 50 for small bucket of fresh corn and thb100 for large they eat cucumbers and other fruits the temple will get these fruits from the market through donation no entry
do not go let the temple be and you move away from the people wanting to take you there
do not miss the paramotor and make shore that mark going to fly with you because its not about the beautiful view its also about the amazing places that he will explain it for you
do not miss this place it is not crowd beach you can have you privacy and you can enjoyed many sunsets same we did in tow week no so fare from our resort four season
do not use this company for diving they are not a real dive company we booked a 2 dive trip but when we arrived at the dock discovered they do not own a boat the boat they were planning to use the captain did not
do not visit this place never there are lot of much more beautiful and wild waterfalls and
do not visit this place we read in a travel book about the waterfall which we decided to visit
do yourself a favour and pay a visit to tarutao national park this place is an absolutely perfect
doi suthep is another place where you have to go there is place so beautiful you will see real nature you will hike up the mountain to wat doi suthep when you up there you will see the beatiful views
doi suthep temple is a very beautiful and amazing temple our tour guide was very enthusiastic and provided a wealth of knowledge and history of the temple the carvings
doing a couple of hours of volunteering picking up garbage and chopping some banana leaves for the elephants
don t do this we noticed before we got on the elephant that it had blood on its forehead five minutes into the ride we realized why for no reason that we could see
don t expect a michelin star buffet the locations chosen at both islands were perfect and for the second island you ll
don t go for a ride in elephants
don t go was disgusted to see 2 baby elephants tied up to chairs very distressed making awfull noises this is not what people want to see anymore they were clearly in a lot of distress shaking and rocking didn t stay to
don t need the guide but the one i like it s samrong beach simply beautiful and feature clear crystal waters
don t waste your time on this waterfall there is literally nothing there you walk about 500 metres to nothing just a tiny waterfall that s not worth your while
dongtan beach was nice and clean not crowdy and quiet the shore is not very wide but comftable nice boulvard trees supply enough shadow
dove several times with pimp my dive and had a fantastic experience each time one of the best shops on koh tao
drinks served efficiently as the best word for it great views but a little disappointed as was quite rundown
drinks were awesome and the staff were incredible my advice would be to get a vip bed on the top it s so worth the good views and a little more privacy also make sure you book the transfer
driver good speak english carefully drive us to elephant trekking and tiger kingdom we very happy and will call him again next holiday confirm
driving through yasothon to ubon we decided to take a detour visit this stupa temple well worth a visit not at all busy we were the only 2 visitors during the whole hour we spent there the lady selling drinks at the
drove from chiang mai and thoroughly enjoyed the experience cool temeratures and beautiful temples
drove into it accidentally after a seafood dinner and was blown away by the beauty and the lights home to some of buddha s remains and monks had the priveledge of meeting a buddhist nun love how they repurpose plastic water bottles into glasses you will
drove up as far as the canopy adventures drop off and hiked up to the waterfall no water flowing though
during a visit to ao nang recently we decided to try a local tailor g armani was close to our hotel so we popped in after some encouragement from the boss outside the service was fantastic and the product we received was great there are many
during our vacation in pattaya we had visited the beach many times it was nice to walk on the paved footpath along the beach soaking in the views of the sea with different types of boats and the pattaya skyline at many places the beach
during the low season all long tail boats park at this beach
early bird phi phi island was amazing they crew of the speed boat and tour company were professional and super friendly throughout the whole trip our guide molly was well spoken and very helpful we had a torn 1000 bht note and

easy to take a taxi here and enter the national park it s about a 30 min walk through the trails to a hidden sandy beach we saw lizards on the way lots to clamber over sandy beach was also lovely for a swim swing
elephant bathing and forest adventure our guides were fantastic friendly
elephant bathing and tracking with family it s must do when with kids elephants are cute and friendly food was amazing
elephant carer home was recommended to me by my friend who does volunteer work involving elephants and sustainability i knew it would be an ethical organization and what i saw during my experience confirmed that it was the most amazing thing i have ever done
elephant jungle sanctuary was a sanctuary that was meant to care for elephants to ensure they
elephant parade house on charoenraj road
elephant rides
elephant sanctuary park
elephant trek and a shooting range
elephant trekking was on her bucket list we took part in a one hour elephant trek over varied terrain
elephant world is a nice combination of a tourist friendly attraction and a ecological animal friendly environment this is a sanctuary for elephants rescued from abusive jobs around thailand they are treated with dignity and care there and that is nice to see about the tour the
elephants
elephants aren t meant to be ridden although there is no sign of abuse during the ride
elephants at home is the place to be my son and i had a amazing time with the elephants best experience ever the elephants are happy and they live in the jungle without chains the people family take good care for the elephants and they
elephants habitats will be destroyed keep up the great work sophie if any visitors love wild life
elephants in wild life they are not friendly
elephants trekking
emerald buddha
emerald buddha and reclining buddha this trip was perfect our tour guide suki spoke great english

encouraging and knowledgeable had a great time learning to dive
end of july we booked two tours with pm travel the 1 day doi inthanan eco trekking and sightseeing tour and the river ping kayak tour we were very satisfied with both tours and can strongly recommend them careful in both cases

english guide who was very informative not crowded or rushed elephants appear well looked after and staff clearly care about their welfare
enjoy and mesmerizing the beautiful scenery of mother s nature of the butterfly farm with all kinds of beautiful colors of butterfly and fresh air of the farm
enjoy mountain biking
enjoy the time at the waterfall expensive fee but is ok swimming and climbing to top was nice i like to comeback
enjoyed our short hike to the waterfall and were treated at the end with the waterfall it likely will not be the most spectacular you ve ever seen but the climb up in the national park
enjoyed the beach and swimming we were there in the off season so not many people nor boat traffic beach was nice for walking
enjoyed this beach
enjoyed visiting this church as it was a relaxing little mental break from the rest of the island would not interest all those that travel to koh chang but as my fianc is belarusian we were particularly curious to see it although there is a
enjoyed walking around this memorial park and viewing the giant statue with her back to the ocean the memorial wave wall was also very reflective as no information we did leave with many questions but appreciate the thai people s desire to move on and not
enjoying beautiful views of land and sea and a 5 star crew that went over and beyond to make sure everyone was having a great time the
enough drinking water and the usual sun protective gear we were advised food cannot be taken into the park
entrance fee to the white temple
epic views
especially compared to ao nang beach
especially dive instuctor dirk and divemaster mas who made our liveaboard trip something special we enjoyed fantastic dives around the similan islands as well as some dives on koh bon island
especially for the price they teach you about elephants
especially on the first dive where he had to take care of one out of the 4 divers
especially on the important days when people walk with lighted candle around phra ubosatha ordination hall this royal temple is very important for bangkok it houses two of three most important and most beautiful bronze
especially the waterfalls crystal clear water which was nice refreshing to swim in canteen food was poor so take snacks
especially those who were supposed to bring some good atmosphere making only noise and dancing like stupid people if you like and know what muay thai is

generally ban saen was a grubby sort of place the seafront is very run down and the beach littered with rubbish we only found one decent restaurant could not wait to leave after 5 days would definitely never go back

hotspring and huay tho waterfall the guide nacha was initially good but during the end of the trip
how anyone was allowed to build a resort on this beach defies me
how can a rich community as kata karon can not present a small water park for young childrens all around the area full of littering not one garbade bin around
however given it is a hidden beach with some cats and monkeys
however not once did anyone go swimming it is not a swimming beach
however this is not the best island when it comes to swimming the waters are often muddy due to the winds and currents so it really is more
however we did enjoy finding pretty shells on the beach does that say it all quite sad actually because the beach itself is spoilt by the abundance of flip flops and rubbish smells of stagnant water too so mosquito
huge park
huge park nice to relax here with the tram ride or bicycle ride i especially loved the cafe souvenir shop lovely chiang rai products for sale here

if youve come to party november is not ur month all party venues closed otherwise still the same amazing natural wonder of the world
im reviewing ta chai island as very good because it was beautiful and the water was stunning but it was not something i have not seen before in hawaii and australia i personally would not waste all the time it takes to travel there from karon patong
impian dive center is amazing
impressed with the history and activities bamboo rafting swimming elephant riding the view from kwai river is amazing
in a peaceful temple hat yai is a large
in an area where they were all well taken care of then we had lunch before setting off trekking through the jungle to an amazing waterfall when
in ao nang i dived around the local sites with poseidon divers we went to ko sii
in depth preparation and careful and safe diving experience would recommend to anyone wanting to do a dive near koh tao
in face it is gonna be tourist everywhere it is just less at surin beach and more relaxing
in fact had only done mountain biked two other times the hike was fantastic
in generall a pretty boattour throrugh the rain forest
in our flip flops craziness haha it was very beautiful we saw many group of monkeys at the waterfall
in our opinion one of the best beaches on koh phangan good balance between liveliness and rest relaxation not overcrowded good massage on the beach we once stayed here at salad hut
in the island if you are a beginner or an experienced climber
in the sense of still being leoland this business is gone now it is re opened a few months ago as pororo water park

informative and explanatory he gave us an overview of bangkok history and the story of buddha we then
informative and funny and were clearly very passionate about the elephants i would highly recommend this to anyone
instead of normal tourist tours so i did some googling and found phuket extreme enduro contacted ian and he managed to set up the trip on very short notice we took about 5 6 hour trip around the jungle
interesting historic bldg on the river no reason to book a tour just walk here and have a look security guard was on duty but his main job apoears to be to stay out of the photos he did not bother me or even approach me
interesting learning about the cave from our guide
interesting temple with an interesting history of how it became to be near the beach you do not need to spend too much time here respect the dress code as usual
intricate workings of the temple are incredible and being able to listen to their prayer was
is a buddhist temple containing the mummified remains of the monk phra khru samathakittikhun
is a remarkable place where you can explore a pristine forest and encounter
is an island lifestyle vacation experience the rich marine nature koh wai
is full of beautifully painted elephants which make excellent gifts on the expensive side
is not that good for underwater adventures there are better places for live coral on the east side of the island starting from infoent of bamboo huts and going until the banana rock the hotel on this beach is absolutely terrible both
island 67 kilometers off mainland of s thailand
it  still worth the drive from pattaya and up past chonburi just to play over this outstanding course it is right on the bankapong river so it
it a 45 minutes drive from hua hin arrive to sall village of bang pu and from there decide to rent a boat to take you around the cape to laem sala beach
it a private beach and no photo here people go there to relax and chill out big parking space i hope they get rid of rubbish around the beach
it costs 100 baht per person for the basic package to enter the site you get a view of the  valantine stone  which is basically just a big rock that supposed to shape like a heart
it could have been a very lovely area if it did not have so much garbage that thai people leave right on the shore otherwise views are great and very instagram friendly just cut out all the garbage you might see
it doesn t get lots of play in the off season incredible ocean side views
it gives you an excellent view of the mountains especially the river near the caves it is history amazed me as well
it has a elegant beauty all of it is own it is very popular with tourist so there are many in the area it is worth the crowd to see this beautiful temple and the grounds plan on spending at least an 1 1 2 hours
it has a vaster beach area and less rocky and urchin free beach
it is a beach in phuket
it is a beautiful and quiet beach at the end of soi 4 pratamnak hill good for exercise or to relax on the beach
it is a beautiful temple with amazing mural arts i was there when the artists working on the restorations and a great experience the surrounding area near the channel is also worthy of some exploration
it is a bit boring but from the narrow pier you can use this time for fishing koh samed s maybe most silent beach
it is a bit of a treacherous hike along the river bed but if you wear good shoes and are careful
it is a favourite wang lang market is only some 300 meters as the width of the prannock pier
it is a fisherman village so yes there are lots of boat scuba and freedive boat also leave from here to sail rock to dive the beach is nice
it is a french center but some of the instructors are bilingual so everyone can enjoy a fun dive there i am french but my girlfriend is not and that was not a problem at all about the dive itself
it is a great 180 degrees view you can take nice pictures there it is very windy
it is a heavenly place you have to go there it is really beautiful be careful not to take any tour operator to get there going to phuket and not going to james bond island is a sacrilege in spite of the price of the excursion
it is a hidden beach where you need to travel inside by using four wheel drive normal car are not allowed where the tour guide van driver over there charge with per head count 300 thb when go into the beach club
it is a large and it is the largest and most important chinese temple it is about 150 years old theere is serene atmosphere inside is quite neat there are festivals mainly vegetable meals
it is a long park along pak nam krabi river there are art works
it is a long ride from sairee beach we bite the bullet and paid 800 baht to hire taxi for drop off and pick up from hotel 4 people i am sure you can prob bargain harder for better deal i could not go there just because
it is a nice beach the sand is not a soft white sand
it is a nice drive through trees to the viewpoint where there is parking the views are nice good to see the town below stalls sell drinks and fruit and the area is clean
it is a nice place to watch the sunset however there was a lot of rubbish on the beach and in the water the beachfront bars seem to clean up in front of their premises as the sun sets and then try to get revellers
it is a nice secluded beach with very few people clear waters
it is a really a great sport and apnea total is a good school to learn it i finished my beginners course today and cannot wait to get back in the water for fun dives
it is a really beautiful island on weekdays
it is a really small park
it is a small local temple located about 30mins drive away from sukhumvit 76 a taxi ride costs about 150 200baht or
it is a temple and the mummified monk is clearly visible in a glass case a monk who was well known for his meditation
it is a very large temple and wonderfully decorated
it is a very nice park with special equipment to exercise
it is a water park with many toys there are many people who play to relieve heat and a water park that is not far from the city people will go a lot on saturday and sunday most people prefer to play with family or
it is about 30 minutes drive from town cave is big and have several sections at first section you will be welcomed by family of bats on top and army of crickets on the floor entrance look a bit scary but once you go down
it is absolutely doable for almost anybody the waterfall can be surging or trickling depending on the time of the year this november it was absolutely
it is across from the emerald buddha so it doesn t get all the tourist mostly thai s visitors most doing traditional worship go if you want to see the true working watt be respectful any ware you take your shoes off ask questions and if they
it is all about the view here and we thoroughly enjoyed it from all angles make sure to stop by when in phuket
it is an ideal destination for scooter travellers the new road through the middle of the island is excellent the village itself has bars and restaurantrs ans shops and beaches
it is another place that has good weather and beautiful nature
it is beautiful river with natural number of trees arround there guest house and restaurents near river added atraction
it is been almost a month since we did the tour and we find ourselves thinking about the elephants and overall experience on an almost daily basis we had a great time and our tour guide was the best 100 recommend lanna kingdom when visiting chiang
it is down a soi off pratamnak hill so not the easiest to get to but it is worth it in peak season the beach will be very busy when i went towards the end of february it was fairly quiet the beach is clean
it is great to find a beach in thailand that is not invaded with motorised water sport activities a very peaceful and tranquil beach with good restaurants and cocktails on offer very easy beach to walk at low tide and some of the best sunsets anywhere
it is impressive how you can find beautiful and peaceful temples right in the middle of cities this one is similar to the others i ve been to but what sets it apart is the complete harmony it has with animals from cats and dogs to
it is interesting place if you have never seen mangrove forests it looks so unusual there is one tracking way through thicket this way takes about 45 minutes entrance is free visitors are few
it is located far from popular beach but for me it was good to visit you can use the ticket which you bought from klong plu waterfall to entrance here water was not too much but still beautiful the fishes will kiss your body when
it is located inside the grand palace complex and right next to the wat phra kaew temple emerald buddha temple i really could not understand why it was here and it felt a bit odd to see it as it stood out from all the
it is located near the cho phraya river bank where a beautiful and clean santichai prakan garden park is found however you cannot go in to the fort but only admire from outside it is brightly white and i think they have painted it recently
it is must visit the temple by the river in bangkok the colours and architecture are interesting can be visited with kids
it is my first time on the banana beach tour they gave us bao service
it is natural to buy things for your family and friends back home plan your visit towards the weekend and go to thepprasit road night market it market is open for three days staring friday and closes on sunday night
it is nature at it is finest our tour guides mark and mike or as i now fondly call them magic mike and marky mark were friendly
it is nice to find a quiet beach to relax on white sand
it is no doubt that this is a beautiful beach like before
it is not a waterfall
it is not easy to describe what is this place something like small park with monument and small buildings
it is not often when your expectations are exceeded but the day spent with these elephants went way beyond my dreams there were two couples and two elephants and basically we were their caretakers for the day we cut sugar cane to feed them as treats
it is obvious that this temple contrasts significantly from the others in the city
it is odd i have never reviewed this park it is one of the best in bangkok it is the site of an old golf course
it is one of the best tours in bali and a must visit island you can find these tours at your hotel reception or anywhere in the ubud market they are not very costly and worth the price it is actually something you must do
it is possible to see koh tao island from the top of the temple viewpoint now the chinese temple is a place where many people come
it is quite a spectacular construction on a small island however
it is quite a task to find this place as one has to cross narrow pathways before reaching but the beach is truly secluded and people can have a real nice quiet time here enjoying the sand and the waves there is a nice restaurant
it is really no problem if you are someone who does not need big entertainment or mammut statues and temples to get stimulated
it is really the farm here and there flowers are cultivated
it is reccomanded to arrive there early so you can enjoy the view and the quiete of this place smerald waters with small fishes boat services offered by all  the isles nearby the place is available to peolple coming from outside from 10am till 5pm
it is relatively easy to locate the beach but very hard to visit since you have to walk through the jungle for 25 minutes at very steep slopes however it is a perfect beach but with lots of garbage
it is seen that the remains of the shells are packed into a rocky beach by the sea the shells are fossils of freshwater
it is set high on a hill giving some of the best views of koh phangan you can receive a blessing from the monks or bang the
it is stunning beautiful fish off the coast of the island which you can snorkel and see in the beautiful clear blue water
it is such sad news that these food stall beside lumpini park became one of the victims of the streetfood clean up of the government i have been coming here to eat great authentic thai food for years and had been proudly bringing all my tourist
it is the most amazing experience kayaking past the high lime stone cliffs and maneuvering your way through the mangrove forest we saw monkeys too one jumped in the water
it is the most beautiful exotic beach in phuket very clear water and nice sand sometimes you can even surf
it is the most southern part of phuket and offers great views on every sunny day there is also a restaurant where i have been often for a sunset dinner with family and friends around 500 m before you reach the parking area there is a small
it is very fun to travel using saen saep khlong express boat this is not to be confused with chao phraya river express boat there are a lot to see along the ride we particular liked the bobae market by the khlong looks like a
it is well maintained and stands proudly on the chao phraya river and is yet another piece of history
it is worth the visit just to be on that beautiful dragon lined stairway the temple and shrines are lovely the parking lot is tiny at the bottom of the stairs and be careful on that narrow road
it kind amazing that waterfalls come with hot stream entrance fee charged 160thb person for this place nothing much besides the hot stream waterfall just need a 500m walk from entrance to the waterfall compared to 200thb person for emerald pool blue pool
it kind of came as a bit of suprise to me that the waterfall of tan rua was so easy to access as it was been reading about how difficult it is to get there
it kind of sits about 2 3 hours from bangcock 5hours travel there and back or 40 mins from pattaya which is a beach side city we chose the later as a matter of convenience and
it looks like many thai are motivated to do sports of some kind a considerable part of this park can be used for doing sports there are fitness utilities and even a place to play ball hence there are quite a lot of people jogging
it looks until the end of august having said that the beach was stunning oh well maybe next time
it might be shut for around 2 more years for natural restoration on orders of the government we did get to see it and take a quick
it not quiet rin beach can be divided into two sections with different characteristics rin beach nok is the energetic party beach while rin beach nai has a quieter bohemian feel to it rin beach nok has the biggest concentration of accommodation
it only takes 10 minutes foods and drinks on the island are
it s a challenging 1260 step climb many are very tall stairs up to this temple on the top of a mountain 360 degree from atop there are plenty of landings along the way
it s a disaster again nature and animals there are some scams with high speed boats that they don t respect those of us who prefer the simple paddling boats of the tradition to go around and take pleasure of this little nice market its
it s a park for the whole family from slow wave stroll to exciting slides plenty of stalls selling food and definitely lots of life guard around it s smaller compare to cartoon network but still very fun place
it s a wonderful beach but i ve been to the full moon party i ve seen people pie in that water so i don t want to swim there the area around is busy with a lot of street food and cheap just don t swim
it s a wonderful goddess uma devi temple i advice every one should go there but regretly there is no repect of religion and culture the priests are more like buiness i was very disappointed every way i turned was just money
it s absolutely appalling the poor elephants have 4 5 tourists on their backs
it s amazing the temples here are unique and photographer will love here
it s an amazing place to stay and also great to collect some dive experiences staff was super friendly and helpful highly recommended
it s been going since 1994 and it is a bit run down but the impact on turtle conservation in the andaman sea is amazing well done to the royal thai navy for keeping this important project going and the money given by tourism helps to
it s far out from town about 30 mins drive but it s really popular amongst thais it s a gigantic black buddha image
it s my very first liveaboard i was lucky to start this 4days trip with giamani a luxury boat well maintained with awesome crew on board there were 5 of us and 2 instructors with 1 dive master to make sure our underwater experience is fun
it s not very attractive at low tide and virtually impossible if you want a good swim but it is nice and quiet for a walk up and down the beach
it s our favorite beach not so long beach as chaweng
it s pretty nice to walk on cliffs and a good view but i drove about maybe 20 30 minutes and that was a disappointment but if you are nearby than you can go have a look but i wouldn t recommend it because it s not that great
it s really important to find a guide who keeps professionalism and safety their number one priority when diving in a destination location lawrence does this while maintaining a fun and relaxed i would recommend him for anyone who wants to dive
it s such a great and happy experience diving with sea turtle divers thank you
it s the island with the most beautiful beaches in this part of thailand the water is cristal clear and the beach is clean it s also national park
it s very peaceful with great views towards the mainland on a clear day
it takes a short and easy hike to reach the top of the waterfall passing different sections of it on the way you do have to be careful though as the rocks can get quite slippy the sun was blazing but the water was stone
it takes about 45 minutes to row from loh dalum beach but it was the best surprise i had on the trip the beach is small
it took us maybe two hours hike from phi phi pier to get to this beach but it was worth it it is further so not many tourists go there it is possible to reach it by boat as well if you will hike prepare
it used to be a unique place ruled by the beauty of nature
it was a beautiful temple having intricate carvings on the outside with vibrant colours this place is surrounded with other temples as well overall a good visit
it was a great initiative to have the coastal beaches declared as a national park i was happy to know about this as i enjoy having walks inside national parks much to my surprise
it was a nice day to went to khao hin lek fai the road is good and the view is amazing but be carful to the monkey they was very aggresiv
it was a nice drive to the mountain with many stops on the way and most importantly there is no fee entrance except for getting on the cable car
it was a nice walk from wat arun to the bridge but it was worth to see the wat arun temple when the sunset arrives lovely view and would recommend for a good photo session
it was a pleasure to dive with scuba diving fun
it was a sunny day when i drove a barrowed motorbike from a friend to the shores of ao manao you have to pass a check point with helmet because it is inside the old military base of prachuap khiri khan
it was a top production at one time they had 17 elephants on the stage at the same time
it was a traumatic experience to see elephants and tigers tortured this way i should have read the reviews before going to this park animal cruelty and really sad experience a family with young kids had to leave because the kids were crying to see
it was a very good experience the registration process was painless and the prices were in line with other local dive shops they pick you up from your hotel hostel and
it was a very smart initiative to turn old garbage dump land fill to be one of the largest park in bangkok i live around the corner and utilize this park almost every other day starting from 5 am 8 am in the morning
it was a wonderful sunny day to start beach and island hopping enjoyed the scenery the whole journey from loh lana bay and around other island such aa monkdy beach
it was allot of fun funny and friendly great views i got to see turtle when we where snorkeling i really had a great time

it was an amazing day spent at coco beach plenty of activities
it was an amzing place and people are so nice and friendly beautiful view and the beach so clean i love it and will be back soon
it was an honour to meet not only the beautiful elephants themselves but the passionate staff who tour and care for these animals the owner is a fantastically generous host
it was an incredible adventure jungle and height that takes your breath away professional team with professional equipment that leaves no chance to fear we were the whole family
it was at the end of a one month stay and i really loved the entire experience first we went to a village with 8 different tribes so good to see all the differences then a nice lunch at a local restaurant overlooking the river
it was exciting to ride the elephants but sad to see they had 3 people on the back of the elephant i later found out that that much weight can hurt the elephant the elephants were also intimidated by the mahouts with bull picks
it was fun bring sun screen or you will burn snorkelling all day the guides were great
it was great temple where you can pray respect to phathanjai good for everything to be here nice as always
it was great to understand the mission of this organization and see elephants in their natural habitat i wish these folks the greatest success in caring for even more elephants in the future we learned a lot and enjoyed seeing the elephants up close and
it was indeed the most beautiful beach we visited there no crowd
it was lovely friendly stuff it was amazing riding the elephants it is just sad seeing them in captivity like that
it was my first speed boat tour and it was awesome i am glad i did the speed boat as it was a lot fun and dashing through the sea was another level of experience got many memorable photos it was worth it highly recommend
it was my second time in thailand and decide to go somewhere quite and nice and one of my friends suggested to me go there we went there koh samed beach
it was obvious from the beginning that the elephants are really cared for and are happy
it was ok remember to bring your national park ticket all the time they checked the ticket here too
it was our first time outdoor climbing experience and i was a bit scared but with taw s instructor support i conquered my fear and had so much fun climbing all routes which he set up for us we also tried cave climbing which was very
it was quickly brushed over having decided to visit the waterfall we were shocked
it was really interesting to see the amulets and the people who purchased them it s directly outside a temple so it s easy to dip over after admiring the fortress i enjoyed the little walk through not a place for purchases by tourists just to see
it was really pleasure to train in this gym great coaches friendly staff atmosphere was really good they provide new and high quality gear cannot wait to be back
it was still refreshing we stopped here on a 5 island tour from krabi
it was such a great experience i got to discover bang krachao island which is formed by a bend in chao phraya river and which is commonly referred to as the green lung of bangkok this is an alternately rural
it was surreal the view of the island is amazing the tour also gave me a wonderful experience full service they picked me in hotel
it was the best island tour we have ever had a light breakfast arranged at the speedboat station
it was the only one that offered a later pickup time and included dinner at sunset the boat
it was very windy the first time we went and tes flags to stop you swimming because of the risk of rip tides which you can google about lovely sad and nice warm sea but you cant go out to far this time of year
it will not be worth seeing but it is right next to the royal reception pavilion and in front of wat ratchanatdaram great photo ops
its a beach with white sand and blue waters
its a beautiful beach with nice views like most reviewers have mentioned before but cannot swim here
its a beautiful stretch of white sand beach that has a national park close to it it is a great place to watch the sunset and enjoy a bottle of drink the place is also good for swimming and other water sports what surprised me was
its a carnival atmosphere its the mecca for singles looking for singles hip bars
its a great atmosphere and a great place to visit with some friends only 10 min from phuket
its a real workout got some energy left visit the cave
its a reasonably good day worth doing when all else is closed or you are bored with the beach a touch pricey
its a theme park which is fun for childrens the live show starts at 8 pm after having dinner its a treat to watch with elelphants there are plenty of other attractions also which is worth watching i would recommend this to people to not
its almost been 3 months but 20th may 2019 was the best day of our life as local dive thailand along with born made it memorable for us and they understood that as couple what type of dive we were looking for as a first
its amazing view point in phuket my children loved this place
its at the end of the beach
its croweded all companies have the same speed boats and schedule ours had lunch in a separate island
its quite a drive from aonang isolated and thats its charm otherwise in terms of beach etc it is similar a bit rocky at low tides must revisit
its the bigger ferry where you dont feel the tides hitting your stomach while you are on the sea its a slow ride and a peaceful one worth travelling one side in this ferry
its the must one time visit to the paradise water park even for 1 2 day
its the the best ever water experience with snorkelling and swimming lots of coral fish and blue waters an awesome life experience
its water are clear fishes around you had fun on white sand beach at raya islands which is mostly undeveloped site
ive been there on my holidays at karon beach the staff is really nice
ive been to both ava water park and black mountain

most of the area of the beaches have been taken by resort for personal use most of the time people here spend time only for lunch and do a quick view but this is a great place for photo since they have one small bridge
most of the temple is construct with stainless steel
most of the true tropical evergreen forest occurs on the forested hills closer to khao lak here there is effectively a three level canopy overlooked by a few emergent forest giants the forest has many climbers including rattans
most parts of the wat are off limits due to renovation however
most people do not even notice this wat as they walk past from the river piers to get to the grand palace and wat po which is a shame as it is well worth a look the monks are very welcoming and it is a bigger
most reasonable prices on the island for massages and food always eat where the locals eat no tourist tax

nautilus dive surf is located at the far left of kata beach
near a quiet beach it contains a golden pagoda and a golden buddha
ned not only taught me how to dive but also how to dive friendly to all living lives under the water and the earth above the water
need to fair bits of climbing the steps to go up to the waterfall unfortunately
never been anywhere like this before after a 30 minute sweaty trek through the jungle
never gave it a try to dive at phi phi islands
next to chao fah park pier
next to the sea gypsea village in rawai beach is where leam ka beach laid along the andaman shoreline mingling with locals at leam ka beach is another purpose for going to the beach enjoying the view of lone island in front
nice and peaceful beach good view and good for relaxing i m rent the seat only 20 baht also you can order foods they re have so many kind of foods yummy and fresh also there have a little farm
nice and quiet beach as not many western tourists come here just hope the people that do come would pick up their rubbish the road to the beach needs a bit of skill to make it all the way with a motorbike alternative option is
nice and quiet place for the people who would look forward to have and get exposed to thai culture this place is beautiful with respect to architecture and the buddha idols
nice and quite peaceful beach
nice atmosphere
nice beach
nice beach
nice beach for chilling and sunbath the water is pretty clear and good for snorkeling but you have to go a bit further to see the undersea life it is easy to walk from the pier to the beach by walking through the sensi resort
nice beach in more mellow part of phuket like all beaches in this area
nice beach in parts especially in front of hotels but in parts lots of trash washed up or left behind makes it ugly otherwise be a nicer beach nice and quiet this time of year long huge beach with access to restaurants and massages etc
nice beach not the best but it has much of shadow for your thai girlfriend or friends worth visiting only if you stay plenty of days in rawai and you have been everywhere else peaceful place
nice beach with a expensive restaurant on the top of the cliffs with a lovely view we went there and watched the sunset
nice beach with enough shade a lot of dead coral but still great snorkeling loads of fish black tip reefsharks and turtles
nice big boat and friendly crew some ok spots too see specially the emarold cave was nice but most of the time is on the boat and waiting to get to the next location was almost 2 hours delayed when we took the trip 2
nice calm area compared to the other two tourist driven villages on koh tao walking distance from the resort we stayed on view point resort can get a taxi boat here too
nice calm beach but not good to swimm because many stones when you go inside but water and sand good quality
nice choice of dive sites and routes for each site
nice dive spots and friendly crew i want to recommend this
nice island for a quick and cheap daytrip from pattaya ferry trip takes about 45 mins and costs only 30 baht for one way beaches were much nicer and cleaner than in pattaya and you could even swim here not recommended in pattay did not rent
nice little beach for snorkeling shade trees were good to keep cool can rent kayaks too restaurant on the beach as well
nice little park next to surf house on kata beach took my kids there in the evenings so i could just run around the park nicely kept and very clean
nice little park with some benches and trees some water features and work out stations next to the bangkok corrections museum which was closed for renovations
nice little temple with great views of koh samui we just got a taxi there and it waited to take us back it is fairly small so does not take that long we went in the afternoon and there was hardly anyone there
nice local temple with a lot of thai massage all around massage from 100 bht get a true local experience and visit this place
nice looking temple and other buildings
nice place the nature is breathtaking but not a nice place for swimming but great for chilling
nice place to spend a couple of hours plenty of food and gift stalls to look at we brought several souveniers two decorated bowls and a small elephant
nice place to stop to look the ancient construction of this reclined buddha
nice place to visit in chiang rai no entrance fee it is a small temple with impressive exterior amazing archiecture
nice place warm staff nice service friend and polite people good location in patong close to beach
nice restaurant with a big terrace direct on the river the food was good but not great they had live music when we were there nice and relaxing atmosphere
nice route setting for climbing and bouldering in a relaxed atmosphere very friendly and helpful stuff absolutely worth a visit
nice sandy beach
nice scenic view over the sea
nice sculpture but otherwise nothing there apart from a wall with small inscription a huge and moving event but this park doesn t move or inform
nice sea beach chair available
nice sea snorkeling nice photo and good for snorkeling in krabi and long time for snorkeling a lot of fish and coral reef
nice small beach off the mail road where i went for my short morning jog nice breeze though some rocky area but still nice
nice small park and was kept clean i got my kids here and just let them spend time there 2 3 hours easily while we just relaxed ourselves
nice snorkeling the beach was pretty and clean careful of hidden rocks when swimming the kids got a few cuts on their feet you can rent kayaks to go out to the little island you can swim to the island but it is further than
nice to take a stroll away from the resort and walk along the beach lovely and sandy though sea not too clear but makes up for it by being so warm a few places to get a drink along the way
nice tour for bluefish i went 4 islands tour and tiger cave temple it is good for 4 islands tour and tiger cave temple
nice uncrowned clean beach shallow calm clean waters good for kids nice views close to shops and food many massage tables available on the beach hawkers friendly and nota hassle
nice view
nice view
nice view of the chaweng beach beautiful blue see greta place for nice photoshoots can walk down till the sea but be careful as its very rocky best time to view is during sunny day when sun is still up
nice view of the sea
nice walk to this beach
nice waterfalls we went up to number 4 there seem to be 7
nice white sands beach
no atmosphere and very few stores extremely disappointing and lacklustre the people running the stores were very rude and arrogant and tried to make fun of pick a fight with
no bar or cafe just a pagoda on a beach it is great to photograph and to contemplate
no better way to go meet the elephants elephants are treated so well which is rare for this type of tour in thailand the staff where so friendly and informative
no cruel training only riding and natural life
no meat the food in this temple
no need to weigh yourself down every time you hop out the elephant sanctuary was breathtaking being able to feed
no one would believe that this is a hot waterfall
no plastic to be seen on the beach thanks to people who look after
no rides just being with them in their natural habitat
no rocks as you enter the water there is plenty of fish to see when snorkelling near the rocks
no views just
nobody was there this is very very bad it was great and cheap cable park now it is in history
non stop cars and boats going around chaweng and playing eye of the tiger slipknot non stop and brainwashing all the tourists in town totally ruins the environment on the island hopefully the government will make them stop
north facing beach of mostly soft sand but enter the sea and there are a lot of shallow rocks nice beach front restaurants and not too busy yet
not a great trip you spend half the day as part of the commute the springs are so very crowded even in off season the emerald pool is underwhelming especially because of the crowds about as serene as a circus what a waste
not a ton to see here we just floated by on our boat it is just a cave i am not sure if you would have a better experience if you got out and walked around
not as advertised actually a very expensive taxi tour of the country started off well with a drive to a waterfall which saw some dirt track driving but no swimming then we had to drive for hour on main road to get lunch
not because it looks like the amazing wat phra kaew
not crowded we were lucky the temples are clean
not far from the small chinese temple called chao pra seua here you can see a typical thai style buddhist temple with
not just a one time thing like many other dive schools much love for pearl 3
not located in the quietest area but you will quickly forget about the noise when you enter this beautiful temple with a huge statue of bouddha as per tradition and many other little ones around it the decorations all around the temple are simply stunning
not long returned from thialand and just wanted to say what a great experience doing atv for three hours which included visiting waterfalls was although we could only do single inflatable kayaking
not many art shops here anymore most have been changed into tattoo shops they still have very talented pieces to view or buy
not many people are very natural is a bay with white sand and a port for fishing
not many travelers come here locals came here to pray for nak house next to the temple this holly place was rumored that if you wish for something
not much fishes nor reef to look at very small strip of beach to explore or chill on
not much to see on this busy roundabout in the middle of the island
not only with dive information but also suggested accommodation and tours we did not have time in our itinerary to do a live aboard so we opted for
not overcrowded beach
not really brilliant but worth the visit as it is in a lovely area of the beach the beach itself is not brilliant shallow ans silty with a jelly fish warning when i was there but there are plenty of eateries and things to see
not really what i would call a jungle trek however it was still worthwhile with the visit to the big buddha and wat chalong
not recommend to those really want to catch big fish bros just catch a few small fish which you can catch the same size fish at mai kao beach wasting time and wasting money
not so many people there the temple itself got some space and interesting looking architecture
not so touristy beach
not the cleanest place in the world but the views out way both the climb to the top and the lack of facilities a tiny tem hidden off the well worn tourist map
not the greatest tour and no real commentary of any worth from the english speaking tour guide the buddha is not completed yet and looks more like a construction site views are amazing but apart from that it is pretty average seeing a baby elephant
not the most luxurious boat in khao lak but everything was well organised by the amazing dive guide and the crew of the boat as mentioned by other reviewers
not too many on the boat which was immaculately kept it was wonderful view of phuket from the sea appetisers and cool juice was
not trained in their gym but seen all the equipment and looks like a very good gym one negative comment the car park needs some work but
not vey exciting but the white temple museum is spectacular the blue temple black house museum are equally as fascinating the golden
not worth to snorkel or dive the water was milky not fit for snorkeling or diving
not wow quiet short two zip line the view is great value for moeny bit expensive for what you get very friendly
nothing is too hard he s phi phi island tour is a great day out as is
nothing much no beach at chicken island just stop and took pictures from the speedboat view was nice
nothing much to see good for day and night photo taking pretty empty park with only this dragon status and fountain
nothing special but better than what we experienced at ang thong marine park
nothing special would bother used a tour company but best to do it on your own with other temples etc via sky train spent at least half the 4 hours in traffic
nothing spectacular about it though the planes weren t landing over the beach in the few days we were here
o and the odd cocktail good way to meet people the bats taking off to go to ao nang to feed was amazing at sun set
o has the best time of my love i loved every second of it everyone was super super friend you get lots of food play with elephants they are so sweet i love it i will come back again everyone should come back again
ocean sound made my aow a fun and informative experience it was just myself and instructor freddie on the dives patient and enthusiastic
of the elephant places i have visited in se asia a most enjoyable few hours for the family spent walking
off beaten track pagoda on the beach very popular with local people not a touristic place genuine
off to the right of where you think it should be a relaxing atmosphere and beautiful stained glass windows the whole thing is beautifully decorated recommended for a visit
offers a good view have some great sea food restaurants nearby can book boats for island tours great place to relax and have a nice time in the evening
oh this was a lot of fun i enjoyed the ability to be in smaller groups and be with the elephants i can tell they take great care of the elephants as they were soooo happy the food was great too thanks for an amazing
ohkajhu farms restaurant be organic from their farm to your restaurant table in 28 hours very fresh vegetables so if you love salad this is your place also has fruit healthy gut and happy body is their moto if you need more has salmon
ok bottle beach is amazing
ok have visited monkey beach twice in 4 years it is really very exciting t see the monkeys up close however both times i have been tourists nd tour guides alike have given soft drink
old school atmosphere
on boat and on sea canoes were friendly and wonderful tour
on my way back with the scooter from wat phra that doi suthep very few western tourists and many locals i highly recommend for you all to take time to stop by very peaceful
on our way back to phuket we stop by at this national park to check out the nature and to find the small sandy beach but we didn t worn proper shoes so trekking in jungle trail wasn t suitable for us as my youngest is 5
on our way by scooter from ao nang to the tiger cave temple just realized this big rock and the buddha statue it was a 20 minutes short visit

on the east of island
on the tour this was a 30 minute stop on approach we passed elephants in small confining yards where locals were offering the chance to feed them by selling bananas sorry
once you have parked and are on your way up to the waterfall you have no choice but to walk through an elephant trekking park the sights we saw reduced me to tears
one can find divinity and solitude by meditating for a little while here not as crowded as other popular temples in phuket
one could enjoy the sunny day along this area beautiful greenery and magnificent view of the farm with
one day of perfect place to be with friends at the beach or for snorkelling you should take food to the island drinks you can buy there
one for sea lions and the other for birds tigers each show stays for 10 to 15 minutes
one of few canals left to be used as a transportation route boats start next to wat saket and with a exchange stop at pratunam
one of most recommended rooftop bar in bangkok i had a chance to enjoy the sunset up there with a breathtaking view over the city the food was served in fusion styles really enjoyed the atmosphere and will definitely visit again
one of my best rides such a amazing environment to experience on two wheels safest way to get lost in thailand jungle with a very experienced guide
one of my bucket list locations was phi phi island and maya bay the tour was great however we were very disappointed by the state of the beaches it was littered with rubbish
one of our favourite temples
one of the best bays i have visited difficult to drive to but amazing to walk to along the beach and well worth the walk
one of the best beach we have been the clean water sandy was great swimming here was amazing foods was fair price highly recommend
one of the best viewpoints we found on the island beaches in the distance angular rocks below a picnic area above and a ramp that provides easy access to the lower viewpoint

one of the nicest people you can meet in kata beach it is by change that i met him in one of the side roads
one of the places in bangkok i often come to eat is at paradise park shopping center
one of the stops from our hong island tour

one of those movie scene picturesque thailand beaches white sand crescent beach with a big pile of granite rocks at each end
one thing i like about bangkok is this huge park it has a lot of mass activity going on jog
one word review bland i found this tour to be neither good nor bad would i like to do it again with andaman sea travel no met some nice people on the trip from egypt and poland so it was not a total waste

open and honest answer from rachel which convimced me in the end we did two easy dives with
or guide was amazing she was knowledgeable and fun the sights from the temple were stunning as were the pagodas it was raining when we got to the waterfalls but that didn t matter
or to explore the park to see some animal such as watusi cow
ordinary small chinese temple do check out street arts on its wall on the way in nothing much inside the temple nothing unique too only the street arts on its wall on the way in are worth your time
organisation and safety my dive master
other reviewers are correct that this is not a true elephant reserve however
others very ornate but they are usually found in larger towns and cities this beautiful temple is in a semi rural
our boat cruised past viking cave all you see is a cave entrance with a small wharf that is meshed off to stop people landing i suspect another victim of over visitation
our boat guide was really friendly to us during our trip he explained us a little bit about the rain forest and the animals that are living there he made some stops for pictures
our cab driver brought us here when the partner wanted to see more silk while returning from the river rafting i thought i would be bored

our tour was really fun the bike on the island was scary
our very first time on an elephant we totally loved the experience and such a lovely little place to relax and take in the sights the elephant that we cruised on was wonderful the handler was great too gently nudged the animal when he wanted
our whole family of 6 people enjoyed one hour boat ride and elephant ride but was very expensive mire than usd 100 per person not ideal for kids below 6 yrs elephant ride was an experience we could not see it feed the tigers becoz
ours had 2 climbers and 1 instructor the views at the top

paradise park farm will leave you utterly speechless with its spectacular views staring out at the skies
paradise park is located land atop koh samui highest mountain situated at such magnificent heights on this lush tropical island
paradise waterfall koh phangan is definitely worth a stop even in dry season from rope swings to interacting with local kids paradise waterfall koh phangan was definitely our favourite although there wasn t really any fast flowing water due to dry season
park is well kept with clean toilets you will need a bit of fitness level to see whole park
part of our wonderful long tail boat trip to james bond island food was okay interesting history and good to support the people on the island but please tourists please do not encourage the man with the poor gibbon dressed in human clothes it s cruel
part of the 4 island tour we stopped here to snorkel and it was a great opportunity to take pictures of the island that looks like a chicken more like a turkey in my opinion
particular if you choose the ridge route and go to the view points of doi suthep it
parts of this beach are very rocky
patience and professional guy we did a try out in the pool and after that i decided to do a dive with him near the resort it went well and
pattaya beach is really nice during low season there are no boats
paul cheng 4 star hinlad waterfall temple considered one of the perfectly quiet sanctuaries that having waterfall runs through and almost surrounded by the waterfall hidden in them green green woods

peaceful and the view is excellent from different direction
peaceful bay at the very end of the island
peaceful easy going ride takes you away from the madness of bkk sounds unbelievable but true it takes you on a boat across the choa phraya river to a placs called bang kachao its all about bikes
peaking into the lives of local people working on the island and a very knowledgeable guide there are plenty of stops to eat and drink
people on this island are the nicest i have ever met everyone is welcoming

perfect visibility and best dive centre in siouthern thailand super fast boat with 3 silent engine
personally i believe in supporting any efforts to regenerate green spaces in urban cities here at metro forest

petra is the most fun instructor we could have asked for all the dives were safe and enjoyable
phang nga bay is best known for khao phing kan the island which featured in a james bond film the whole area is beautiful however and our cruise with adaman was very enjoyable we were a group of 33 and the yacht was more than
phangnan and tao with the various ferry operators i guess thousands of tourists sail from here without realising that this beautiful temple set up high on the cliff is there it
phi phi island is one of a must visit place to when you are in thailand or krabhi we had a fanstastic time here island hoping the price was rather cheap affordable snorkelling under water diving was so fun with the corals

plenty of restaurants to choose from which are not pricey at all the beach chairs are free to sit on as long as you order at the bar or restaurant water is clear and not big waves so families with small children are welcome nice
plenty of seats to view the lake and we did see a big monitor lizard
plenty of them to choose from sandwich to smoothies nice sunset view with snack is a bonus
plus there is a no tourist when we go there at 9 30am you are rewarded with a fantastic 360 view of chalong and makham bays
poor quality performance we have been to many elephant camps in thailand and laos this one is lowest on quality standards so if you have never seen elephants then it s ok to visit else skip this one
potentially a wonderful beach but largely eroded it hosts a number of major hotels and apartments along the beach front and a few seafood restaurants on the southern end when naklua develops more the beach hopefully will be cleaned up
powdery soft sand and dotted with big rocks good for snorkeling and swimming there are a few hotels and restaurants a long the beach there are only a
praise the lord that looking up to our island and gave us a church where we can now offer up our prayer to the almighty thanks to the church authorities who built this temple for us thanks to father sergius that he prays for us
pretty cool aquarium with you walking under a glass tube its setup to walk thru once so not like a theme park or zoo
pretty good temple but the lucky buddha review was spot on we got the 40 baht story and then taken to a suit shop i am truely shocked at how accurate the previous review was
pretty temple complex but found it very confusing and packed with buildings close together also
prince of jumborn tribute best known for his contribution and development of the royal thai navy the views of pattaya city including the beach are spectacular lots of beautiful flowers and statues just prior to 6pm they let of fireworks which gave everyone a shock
prior to arriving on phuket island as our stay was over the christmas new year span
pristine beach you can breath in that typical beautiful island beach vibe that we expect when in koh samui it has that obvious crowd factor in the epicenter as it s where all activities and close by hotels and
pristine beaches with so much to see trek up the mountain for a view like no other big gold buddha at the top is quite a sight as well great for all sorts of water activities
probably all the tour operators suffer the same problem there are just way too many tourists exploring the islands we took the one day phi phi island tour during rainy season so we were not surprised to be offered a discount but the
probably the best beach on koh samet island quiet
probably the best idea as this was the third island we visited that morning
professional team delivering well supported dives at a fair price small diving numbers and some good dive sites
public park and easy access to the chao phraya river express boat great for a walk along in the daytime as the shops provide shade form the blistering sun find yourself a
pure white sand and surrounded by stunning limestone cliff part of a national park and the centara beach resort
purina sheep farm koh phangan thailand simplicity of nature
put it on your list the best photographic view on
queen sirikit park is also called lan manggon it is located on thalang road
quiet and so relaxing for me this is a romantic place to visit highly recommend to visit this beach
quiet beach to walk in the morning or evening access at places is not great but very relaxing once you get to the beach
quiet place of the past the northern commercial tip of the island is a congested jam of shops
quiet red flags bit of man made litter from sea some idiots swimming two guys fishing no shells go before 7am
quiet side of the island
quirky little beach bars serving devious food
quite big buddhist temple complex in between khaosan and praathit road no entrance fee for visitors main temple has some pretty paintings depicting life of lord buddha and plenty of golden statues since it s not as popular as more famous ones in the vicinity virtually
quite eerie as the pond is surrounded by thick trees there s a gate enclosure surrounding the pond as i kept looking where are these crocs then you realized it s just beside the wall scary haha i spotted 4 beast the temple is quite a find
quite knowledgeable and explained the various buddha temples we were on time in returning to hotel she also reviewed other areas of interest in bangkok
quite nice spot on southern edge of koh lanta wonderful view
quite nice walking trail along the rock beach and mangroove jungle where you meet group of monkey better visit early in the morning or late evening to avoid direct sun light better brings hat and wear non slip shoes
rafting and waterfall for a refreshing swim thank you so much for a wonderful experience
raht brought us on his easier hike from near kae bae up to 280m high visiting jungle and waterfall 8km loop great fun decent pace on steep hillsides and lots and lots of climbing over and under fallen trees so tough workout all part of
rang hill is one of the attraction point to local foreign tourists it is free to visit monkey feeding clicking photo around the hill point view tower are the main activity limited parking at the top hill
rashi collections are one of the best in ethnic collections in indian wear a must for all to visit to have a homely atmosphere shopping experience seems as we were in india nice collection and affordable rate thank you rashi for such a wonderful shopping

raya dive center s world class professionalism
reading reviews about the othe major waterfalls i saw they all had access to elephant treks being an animal lover this was not something i wanted to see even if i was not going to partake i would rather forego seeing a waterfall all together if
reading the reviews to make sure it was an ethical sanctuary for elephants i am so glad we booked to come while in thailand it was a magical experience
really beautiful marine park and views went there with a day tour
really enjoyed fabulous view and crew staff are all very helpful and speak quite good english recommended to all my friends
really enjoyed this place this morning not a lot of tourists so it was so nice to just walk around and enjoy the beautiful temple well worth the visit

recommend this island
red mountain gc
reef dive centre on koh tao is the most expensive dive center on koh tao their prices are almost double than the other divecenters this because they are located in a resort that claims to be a 4 hahaha very unpleasant speedboat captain that needs
relatively friendly dive buddy what i was disappointed about was when i asked due to the rare storm than arrived early jan 2019 if visibility was still going to be ok as if visability was near 0 i
relaxed and friendly atmosphere what was reflected by customers as well for me since 20 years experianced diver and my wife beginner they made individual tailored service to your needs even our kits
relaxing and a great way to see the rainforests of thailand then we visited the sea turtle
relaxing atmosphere in the shop
rent a scooter and whiz out to this fishing village on an island where there is not much to visit this colorful village is worth seeing getting there is half the fun
restaurants and cinema probably the biggest in hat yai with huge car park suitable for eating out and relaxing both at weekdays and weekends
restaurants and just outside is a great view of the biggest river in thailand it also has a very nice natural rock store
return back after 3 years for more than 10 dives package november 2015 and 2018
revisited this year and found system slightly changed the entrance fee to pier and the national park entrance fee were collected in advance at the same time it follows that the boat will not stop over at koh tarutao anymore for the national park entrance
richelieu rock is an amazing place to dive
riding up through a red white barrier next to a little gatehouse and negotiating a quite treacherous mountain road by motor scooter i would
right in the center of the island are two newish golf courses loch palm and red mountain on the same vast site carved into the hills between phone town and patong beach it is of little interest to anyone else except golfers for there is
right next to the chao phraya river and a short walk from the express river boat stop phra arthit pier a peaceful park with lots of trees and the sound of birds chirping which successfully
right on the beach the food was really good
river and the geographical formations nothing amazing but you will probably spend a few minutes here
rivolting black sewers full of rubbish and oil spilling onto the beach
road to bottle beach includes 4 extremely steep downhill tracks which are uneven and cracked it was one thing getting down these on a standard scooter but getting back up was almost impossible and involved pushing the bike up at a steep incline this
rocks check out fat turrtle at the phra ae end of long beach too
rocky river in our raft white knuckle finally
roctopus diving was fab i unfortunately have health problems so opted for snorkelling but the team were super nice and supportive rachel was lovely setting it all up for us my friend went on the dive
royal or religious in the meantime used as a car park for tour buses open for business until 6 pm as convient shortcut for passers by
sad to visit and see birds in very small cages the park located at jungle area with many mosquito as well so it is not the place where you wants to bring your child and back with many bites from jungle mosquito
safe and thorough teaching and well situated near to many beautiful dive sites ueli is the calmest and most patient dive instructor i have ever met his enthusiasm for his job made my dives the best i have ever had i would recommend anyone who
samae beach s sand is not as white and as fine however
same as windmill viewpoint
same story as already mentioned it starts with a nice man who helped us in a temple and led us to the tuk tuk driver holy day and the driver drives you all the day long for 20 baht blah blah and you end up
sammy was on time picking us up from our hotel and we enjoyed an air conditioned drive in a spacious and luxurious van to ayutthaya sammy answered all our questions and offered us tidbits of information on the drive there we stopped at multiple temples
samrong beach is located just near the six senses resort tucked away between two headlands is near the most northern point on cape plai laem we were driving around koh samui resort hopping we noticed this gorgeous beach whilst on our way to
samui elephant sanctuary do not let you ride elephants if they are offering rides it is a scam do not use the real sanctuary let you feed them enjoy time with them not ride them
sandy beach
sandy beach with a few places to eat if you are lucky you will get to see the elephants in the sea
sandy beach with lot shallow water safe for kids
saw the roof of the temple from our hotel room at the amari and visited the temple on the way to the seven eleven nice little temple and looks lovely when lit up at night
saw this beautiful temple across from the airport and made a quick visit there is easy access from the airport via an overhead pedestrian bridge with hardly any visitors
saw this park and had to check it out so glad we did it is a lovely park
saw turtles up close and had an amazing time service was impeccable manu even showed me round the island night life after my diving highly recommended for anyone who
saw very interesting sites you won t see anywhere else visited a crocodile farm
scenic views
scuba dawgs is a professional dive operation with good staff and equipment and if you are diving in pattaya
scubaquest is one of the best divecenter i dive with in thailand safe fun and always make the best for me good service and perfect guiding hope to see you all again soon benny
sea
sea and sunset and sometimes you can see elephant bathing on the beach too
sea bass
sea eagle is the undoubtably the best all the crew members speak english gave very clear instructions with snorkelling and returning times to the boat when some friends were not feeling well crew members provided headache remedies they are so kind and caring
sea food not so fresh and everything was served so fast
sea hi andaman was our operator which we booked online pick up from the hotel organized from karon
sea kayaking yesterday was awesome 10 hour day
sea turtles
sea urchins
sea walk
seang chan beach is not visually attractive because rock groins have been built along it to stop beach erosion in mild tides
seastar offers the best island hopping tour and the have the best tour guides we we went to khai and james bond island tour with seastar this was our second island hopping in phuket and we enjoyed this much more than the first one we
second time back it s a great park with some great fishing the food is very good and traditional the only down side is they charge foreigners 3 times more the thais which is ridiculous and makes it very expensive the fish care is very poor
secret spots and a great education and training during our dives we saw turtles
see buddha statues in meditation and dive into another religion for a while nothing smashing exiting but a nice break when you explore the island on a
seems like an exclusive beach as not many people venture here and it is mainly enjoyed by the resort guests
seems to be a lot of rubbish on the beach which does detract from the beauty seems to be a lot of currant and a place you would need to be careful if you want
send beach and good wind usually blows fron east
serene and beautiful location
serene gardens contrasted the busy traffic outside rest rooms were in good order gardens are obviously well tended worth a visit
served coffee soft drinks and fresh fruits and off we went to racha island
service and atmosphere there is a farm nearby
service mind staffs take good care of their customers especially my dive leader on the 2nd day
service was good and the food on the sea angel was good the tour guide called tony was great and really knowledgeable however the tour was not what was advertised and left us quite disappointed the reason for the three
set against the limestone rock located beside the main krabi to ao nang road we visited this temple on scooter motor cycle
set in jungle surroundings are two beautiful waterfalls that are certainly worth a visit the waterfalls are known as na muang 1 and na muang 2
setting 2 5 the temple itself is on the corner of the thanon patak road
shady and long beach after a ride on the dirt road through the forest and the rubber plantation
shark point and the racha islands i would not consider going with any other dive centre as tony is not only an excellent dive guide leader but also a great person to spend a day
she was able to dive wonderfully a great experience and we will
shoulder to shoulder sun beds and massage places at end end the beach is much quieter
showed me around some awesome dive sites including a world war 2 shipwreck he even took the time to show me round the town afterwards awesome experience that i highly recommend to anyone
silver beach
silver beach is definitely worth making the time for
similan islands and a ride with the elephant and rafting we found a perfect organization in some amazing place with an agency always available and very kind
similar as the bird park sooo good the birds are cute
similar to patong beach shops and such everywhere along the roads too much trash on the beaches though i wish thailand had a trash pickup service with all the tourism money they make each year it is sad to see such beautiful beaches littered
simply beautiful waterfall signs up suggest swimming is possible
since i was not dressed to enter the temple i only saw the out
since the owner is the jeweller himself a must visit in ao nang
since the park is under renovation
since they are still renovating rebuilding the temple the building is made of wood and all the sculptures and carvings on the walls are hand
singha park also be the good place to get the relax with friends
sip a drink gazing at the river or simply take a nap on the cool grass this also serves as a good location for a few photos
situated just near the base of tiger cave province is peaceful worth a visit if visiting tiger cave
situated on the banks of the chao phraya river
six of us were looking for a day of activities and this trip did not disappoint while we were not huge fans of seeing the elephant riding being offered
smal and beautiful beach near nai harn beach have a good snorkeling set and diving have local restaurant normal quality of food but in low season have a big waves
small and quiet beach
small lake with park around for citizens doing fitness
small place with elephants that take you on short walk then get a bath and some food very friendly staff and a great time
small quiet beach october was very quiet and so it was not crowded or noisy snorkelling was good as well
small temple near the sea area
small temples
small waterfall
small waves as it is predominantly on the downwind side of the island a bit grainy just where the waves
snorkeling and island hopping etc well organized not to forget to mention that our tour guide mr nikom was one of the reasons why our trip was a fun experience he was a very nice
snorkelling
snorkelling
snorkelling and always a great atmosphere on the boat with plenty of food and
snorkelling and wonderful food not to mention all whilst watching a
snorkelling in koh rok and koh ha you can book the speedboat here lanta snorkelling adventures i have done this trip with sinthongchai speedboat they give you the masks
snorkelling underwater scooters the day we went it was beautiful and hot so good to be on a boat and readily able to go
snorkelling was fun
so a positive place to visit the temple and pagoda were only built recently
so alexandra offered me to get 3 fun dives there the sea was calm
so all in all it was just a steep hot walk to some rocks in the jungle
so almost all the animals was hiding there also was alot of reconstruction one distressed tiger one lion one elephant one giraffe not much to see this
so even if there were more people we would have been able to find a great view food and drink were of good
so far so good a harmonious atmosphere very calm no charge is charged for entry to the art house
so glad we booked this as this boat sea canoe tour was a highlight of our trip phuket our kids aged 6 8 loved this day i am a complete scardy cat so was concerned about the canoe going through tunnels into
so got to see the temple in full use incredible artwork and architecture worth a visit if you are nearby
so i m not a fanatic i have seen many elephant camps across asia and india i ve never seen such horrendous abuse as you drive up to the entrance a large bull ellie is chained so tightly he cannot even shuffle
so it is challenging for me and i took longer to reach the viewpoint 3 like around 90mins but the view is definitely worth it remarks do eat something before heading to
so it is good to see it is turning its attention to battling the problem of diminishing numbers of sea turtles in the gulf of thailand by any yardstick
so it was nice walkimg accross chicken island snorkeling was average
so it was only logical for me to try out a uv night dive i was not sure what to expect we went in a small group
so kind of them and they made my trip from amazing to perfection i went to my dream place the elephant retirement park phuket all thanks to shanti 3 thank you shanti elephant retirement park phuket thailand will see you again soon
so much elephant abuse goes on in thailand
so much fun at tree top adventure park huahin first and only one zipline and rope activities in huahin
so myself and a group of three friends had been wanting to do some serious jungle trekking
so only a small boat but nathan bruno were so friendly helpful sangria doritos were supplied hugged the coast so did not go too far out to sea which was good for
so people can eat meat in the temple but mahayana buddhism must eat vegetarian
so pls time your visit accordingly this is the temple used by the royals and hence there is a statue of the king as well in one of the small
so sad to see the beach full of rubbish it would not take long to clean it up so shame on you phi phi for leaving it in such a state and on top of that seriously overcharging to go see it if you stand at
so scuba junction was my first stop on my gap year as i wanted to get in some real open water dives as i have only ever did my open water dives in a lake of heathrow airport i was recommended them by an ex instructor
so the area boasts some of the best seafood restaurants on the island enjoy some delicious authentic thai dishes at these great restaurants the calm shallow waters in this part of the gulf of thailand offer excellent
so the old addage about getting back on the bicycle was true for us and roberts dive team at montalay made it easy for us for about 250 we got the easy adventure training and three
so the waterfall is nice for photos something to do change up the day to day and go for a hike
so there are actually 2 halves of sunset beach if you ask the mototaxis they will take u to the bigger one the one u want is benny s on the beach the sunset is much better there and directly in front of it walk across
so this is where most people come and go there are lots of bars and restaurants just off the beach the sand is nice
so this park which is close to the chatuchak market and mo chit bts station was really a relief to see when i walked through its a nice park where you at least can
so try to combine these two most of the beauty of thai temples are their roof tops of course
so watch where you step seen monkeys just off the beach
so we have been told the island seems very intriguing
so we were not able to go cave walking but that did not matter our hosts ballon and pony were not only informative
so wouln t had to climb up the view is amazing
so you will have to start your journey early if you do not want to miss the sunset
some construction works is on going made the park unnatural the road is much better added a lot of parking
some lovely carvings and buddha images very quiet when we were there still has that genuine  revered  feeling you sometimes
some of the sea food looked good i did shy away from some of the meat products may
some part of lonely beach is being construct i went to find toilet but they were very dirty with poo everywhere and met with thai lady she said its construction worker from neighborhood countries
some snorkelers as well my group had total of 4 divers to one dive master very competent and informative
something amazing happened and my friend and i ended up booking a padi discover scuba diving programme with idivecenter best decision ever we did 3 dives
something really cool to see but nothing to write home about because elephant play a significant part in thai culture
something to stop and see along the way to other adventures such as na muang waterfalls parking is easy ladies do not forget to cover shoulders upper legs it is a temple so you will need to take off your shoes this is a pretty
sometimes new and sometimes falling into the river truly amazing to seem them cooking crabs
sometimes spelled benjasiiri is next to phrom phong skytrain stop the park
sophisticated and accurate atmosphere in every detail
southern end most interesting with the fishing boats and great swimming we preferred to drive to the southern part for calmer swimming waters beach is clean and numerous beach
souvenir vendors good to go to wat arun location is south of thammasat university
special thanks to arm the dive master for guiding me for 2 dives 1st the koh dor 2nd at koh yamabon the dives were great sea life is opulents managed to see some sea horse
spectacular views
speed boat ride to coral island was a bit scary we got worried when the fuel tank wad empty in the mid sea and refill was required enjoyed the beach and drinks at coral island
speedboat trip and very good leader provided good service great light breakfast and thai lunch provided after activities we enjoyed relaxing in the quiet beach very clean and clear beach
spend our last morning on the island as a family here very pretty and private little bay with small beach away from everything except local hotel guests beach use is free as it is in the whole of thailand

the art bridge gallery is now famous for the mural of the cave boys and their rescuers it is a fantastic piece of art that is displayed on the exterior wall of the gallery inside the gallery they are currently running two exhibitions in particular
the atmosphere
the atmosphere in a beautiful corner decorated with various materials
the atmosphere is awesome lots of street vendors with good selection of food

the beach are contaminated with oil leaking from the ferry
the beach at koh hong was beautiful with white powdery sand the snorkeling was great even though the visibility was 2 3 meters the water was shallow enough you could see everything clearly sea cucumbers
the beach has a good location in front of the beach
the beach here is a safe beach and not deep
the beach is a beautiful place it is a pity that the restaurant is run by awful people they have serious communication issues the bartender doesent speak english and the owner is a old man who can only scream
the beach is a bit dark sand which is different from other beaches in krabi you have to rent a car to move around this place because it is long distance from krabi town
the beach is accessible from ao nang beach by a longtail boat boats run throughout the day and it takes 15 mins
the beach is beautiful and perfect if you want to do nothing very much
the beach is beautiful clean and not too many people if you have little kids
the beach is beautiful indeed
the beach is clean and quiet
the beach is crowded moderate sea waves just enough to play around in the sea nothing special about this beach cleanliness also issue sometimes specially after full moon we have better beaches in thailand
the beach is dirty
the beach is not suitable for swimming as it is shallow and mostly crushed coral so you will need footwear to walk along the shore longtail boat tours depart from the beach
the beach is not the best in koh phangan
the beach is separated from the other chaweng beaches by a small river the whole set of four beaches extend to about 7 kms 4 4 miles but its separation makes for a cleaner
the beach is so beautiful and clear crystal sea guide is also kind and helpful during the trip moreover
the beach is spread out on either side of the main pier
the beach is very beautiful but many boats park at this beach the waves is not that high as pattaya beach you can walk to the north point of this beach
the beach isn t for swimming but the pool can compensate this i haven t tried the food yet but the drinks were good and not fully overpriced
the beach itself is lovely but i am sorry to say that there is a lot of plastic and rubbish on it
the beach looked pretty deserted and that was a positive on the flip side
the beach looks a lot better and cleaner than last year less pollution in the water as the water was blue this time around and there were less dodgy hawkers and sellers this time around i was pleasantly surprised and had a a couple of
the beach really does look lovely
the beach so lovely beautiful place to go have a great time there clear sea i am really recommend this place when you go to krabi
the beach was clean with soft sand and we enjoyed the swim not too crowded at around 11 00 am
the beach was fairly clean it is fronted with rows and rows of deckchairs which stretch for miles if you ever need a deckchair please visit bang saen beach there s also some seriously good food stall too
the beach was fine
the beach was packed i saw lots of sunloungers but unsure if they belonged to hotels the sand wasn t soft but it didn t seem to stop people from sunbathing lovely view out on the horizon and the usual beach sellers offering ice creams
the beautiful sunset local food
the beautiful temples and buildings that make up this complex attract many visitors and local thai as well
the beauty of this place is crazy such a stunning island
the best dive center in koh tao
the best experience you can get on the island very sociable place to meet people through sport the place to be on the island
the best high vantage view point on phuket island what is rather ironic is that it looks out over the islands most famous sunset viewing location
the best place that we have visited in koh kood from the views to the stilted walk boards
the best place to learn history of phuket island
the best staff on the island
the best temple in all thailand
the best time to visit tang kuan hill is sunrise or sunset the macaque monkeys will be out in full force be careful they can be quite naughty if you are early or late enough you will probably be the only one it is not
the best to get there is before the sunset
the best way to get to the nice beach is thru the hotels
the big buddha
the big buddha is really not that big if you have been to the other big buddha at phuket but size is not everything this one has the most intricate art work on and around the actual statue do watch out for the time you
the bird s eye view of an impressive city like bangkok makes you appreciate the city even more do not forget the floor glass
the blue temple delivers on being unique in its own way definitely a nice place to visit while in chiang rai
the boat ride is an excellent way to see bangkok from the water the river boat takes you along canals the view you get from here is entirely different from the road
the boat tour was so much fun amazing views
the boat trip and the two consummate professional dive masters
the boat was easy to dive from and lunch was perfect i will dive with them next time
the boats go om bangkok canal from the chao phraya river to pratunam which is next to asoke mall 100 baht 1 way
the boats rides and the cycling i enjoyed eating lunch on a separate island and seeing the
the boot is not a louxe boot but regarding the cost and the beauties of dive sites its fare i like them when you want to dive they just gear you up as robot
the buildings are crowded in together and walking around on the upper terrace lets you see details up close and gives you a view of adjacent buildings too this is really a must see area of the grand palace grounds
the bus ride was long and sleepy the individual tours were fantastic we did not want to do elephant tracking so chose to wash we were not disappointed bamboo rafting was alot of fun and very well worth it turtle refuge
the caddie told me there were 89 sand traps playing golf by the seaside
the cape panwa has its own boat with daily trips to this island which was about 20 mins boat ride away on approach it s a gorgeous desert island with 2 main beaches banana beach and long beach there is one hotel on the
the cave beach is the perfect beach to hang out with your family and friends it has a lot of activities like climbing
the cave is not much to look at but the snorkelling around here was incredible saw huge schools of fish of many colours types
the cave is very interesting and unique it is nice to learn about new things about other religion it is just a small cave and very well kept you can get to phra nang from railay west or east by foot do not worry about getting lost because
the centre is located in a beautiful tropical garden surrounded by mountains and ocean it has several buildings for comfortable meditation with ac and terrace with picturesque views for morning sunrise and evening sunset sessions moreover
the centre of this beach is very busy
the chao phraya river is truly the heart of this amazing city and exploring the canals gives you another unique view of the city and her people i was completely charmed by little houses balanced precariously on decaying stilts making up entire suburbs connected only
the chiang mai mountain biking kayaks is conveniently located in the old city i visited the shop before i signed up for the scienic ride 3 the staff recommended this route as the best trip for xc and views the tour does not begin
the chicken curry is to die for as is the red thai duck curry the whole steamed sea bass is also a delight service is extremely good price is also very very good
the cleanliness at beach needs to improve more shades shall be created for tourists to sit the toilet shall also be expanded
the colour factory sells elephant statuettes these are i think designed by and for the elephant parade 20 of the proceeds of the sales go to elephant welfare and conservation projects this is already a worthy cause but the colour factory is also a place
the company we used to go from phuket to phi phi island
the condition is a large stone courtyard extending into the sea when approached
the construction of this temple was initiated by prince supradit in the 1860s he was one of the 82 children of king rama iv king mongkut the prince died in 1862 and his brother noppawong continued building he died as well before the temple
the convenience of the food stalls and kiosks is great for a day exploring the park they are cash only and spread around in different areas of the park offering thai and some snacks and drinks for purchase vendors were helpful and friendly in my
the counter staff was very helpful there is a tour operator with a representative in the office i could not find a trip adviser review for any of their tours they operate under the name hotelextras the vans are labeled destination services our private temples palace
the crew on the sea eagle including our guide worked very hard to accommodate all the passengers and assure that they were safe the islands were busy even in low season since all the tours leave around the same time and they go to the
the crowded back of the pick up truck arrived on time and the fast boat ride over to richelieu rock was smooth the day we went out the head was clean and the food was good and filling dive master will did a great job
the cruise was really good especially during the night at first you have dinner on the cruise while it is still there are a wide range of different sea food and meat that you can enjoy from king prawns
the day started well loaded onto a comfortable speed boat with about 30 travellers and headed out to sea first stop
the day to visit is what khunaram the mummified monk the sign for the temple says he wanted his body to inspire future generations to follow buddhist teachings
the day was filled with great experiences loved the opportunity to visit the mountain and walk through the mossy forests the temples were incredible i also enjoyed stopping at the local markets well worth the price
the daytrip with sea bees diving was really good
the devasathan brahmin temple is the official centre of brahmin in thailand built since 200 ago located in the middle old town area bangkok city nearly wat suthat next to the giant swing

the elephant handler smacked the poor animal on the head with a
the elephant sanctuary was amazing as many others had suggested great to get so close and interact with them through the various activities everything was great food
the elephant sanctuary was amazing there was about 20 of us to 3 elephants felt a bit rushed but overall we enjoyed the feeding and then washing we then went to the highest point of thailand
the elephants are no longer used for seat riding they are properly cared for now you get to walk with an elephant and hear a little of their history great stop off for everyone and by visiting you will help to keep this very valuable
the elephants are very obviously loved and respected and well cared for and the entire experience was perfect the lunch was delicious as well this is a must do for any trip to thailand do not ride elephants
the elephants do tricks or they have rides it is not a genuine sanctuary
the elephants looked skinny and are chained on a short leash they are rocking back and forth while waiting for new customers i would not recommend the park
the elephants were in a sorry state many seem to be overworked for tourist rides etc conditions do not seem very hygienic
the emerald buddha
the entire experience was amazing the atmosphere was beautiful
the entrance fee is extremely expensive it was about hk 400 and i would rather go to ocean park instead
the experience of the beach is just being amazed and satisfied not too crowdy
the first bit of the path should be closed it s covered in moss and all the wooden bridges are rotting after i slipped i just turned back not worth it there are much better waterfalls in cm with safer paths
the first thing i would say is that the sculptures are free to view
the first two being ccr try a dives to help me decide on which unit to purchase invaluable advice and then subsequent ccr air dil deco and ccr mixed gas trimix courses ben is an awesome instructor along with the
the first visit it is 2 small islands connected so actually it is just one then you snorkel in chicken island which is absolutely ugly there is no beach and the water is not clear so you cannot see any fish third stop at puda
the first waterfall flows into a small pool that you can swim the second waterfall is about thirty minutes
the food choices are limited especially for student budget but i do not regret going very chilled atmosphere
the food park in this mall is quite good
the food was perfect and the service was great we had the best time really unforgettable we went to maiton island and it was beautiful really recommend this boat and the island
the fourth largest cave in the world start with a steep climb about 300 steps and then a crawl through a narrow entrance then the rest of the time walking along boardwalks and down stairs a guide is required but they can
the friendly local guide speaks with a heavy accent and numerous grammatical mistakes i could understand only 50 be prepared to google the stories and history behind the night view was unique and excellent also much fewer tourists at night so we were able to
the general atmosphere of wat phra borommathat chaiya ratchaworawihan very quiet
the gimmick here is a  black temple  well
the glass floor on the 78th floor was super interesting and cool it was nice to be able to experience stepping on it the view was equally breathtaking
the grounds are just off the 402 and worth a visit the reclining buddha is in good condition as are many of the buildings temples be sure to cover the shoulders and the legs lots of interesting little structures to observe as well as the  fun
the group size is really perfect we enjoyed our leisure dive here
the guide and stuff were friendly and all went as planned on that part guide did not speak english though they even took a lot of pictures of me riding the beach we rode on was amazing and as an experience it was one of
the guide told me that the elephants here look relatively smaller than their african and indian counterparts our elephant
the guide was lovely and we visited some great sights she even allowed us to extend the tour to the big buddha for a small extra fee we could have done without the visit to the jewellery shop with it s hard sell saleswomen though
the guide was so honest and down to earth with us we learnt a lot about the history and culture of elephants in thailand on the way there when there we really got to know the elephants and their characters
the high tide brings in lots of trash and plastic low season is not best for sea conditions but this is a good beach
the hike was nice but the waterfall disappointing went up after a few hours of pouring rain and still not much of a waterfall would recommend only if you have nothing else to do
the hiking through the jungle was nice and interesting pan was a very good guide the ziplining was much fun we really enjoyed this tour
the hospitality on board the dive boat and the friendly approachable attitude of all of
the hot spring pool area is quite small and crowded but the water is good and warm and hot water flows down from the mountain beautiful emerald pool
the hot spring waterfall was looking good but management need to be improved how could they allowed a massage service in the close area it s a bit annoying no peace around
the hot waterfall is a natural bathtub in the middle of the forest
the hotels are expensive on this beach but if you have motorbike you can drive any beach on the island all beaches are free it is my favorite beach on samet it is very quiet there are less tourists there for photo shooting it is
the hotspring waterfall is way too crowded
the huge statue of king rama vi stands at the entrance of lumphini park dressed in western clothes
the instructor of the dive experience was very kind and helpful but the water was not very clear that day so it was difficult to see anything
the instructor was great and the dive experience was fantastic i was really amazed by the quantity of wildlife present one of the dive sites had a small cavern where
the interior is far less spectacular than the more famous temples on the opposite river bank if however you prefer less crowded and more  off the beaten path  temples
the island can be visited during the day and there is the most beautiful sand beach that we have seen so far in thailand if you are arriving this area go and visit it lovely and
the island itself could be gorgeous
the island itself is beautiful but you must go early to beat the hoards that begin to arrive by mid morning we chartered our own boat and getting there and back was half of the fun we had about 1 2 an hour on the island which
the island plus surrounding beaches are being flooded with tourists to make a quick buck with very little thought about the actual experience or preserving the beauty of the area full of boats and tourists way too crowded
the items available at arun thai natural are great they are inexpensive and hand made i have bought a number of items from marike during our stay here i was hoping to make some online orders

the keepers put the elephants first and we were smiling all the way home they provided us vegan food too
the key to this experience is doing the overnight we stayed in a karen village with also visited the hillside tribe national park which is 500 baht entry fee and puts a number of different tribes in traditional style homes and dress selling goods however
the khao kanab nam are two big limestone rock hills forming a gateway to krabi and emblematic for the city on the bank opposite the city there is a cave complex formed of two caves one small and dark
the king power pattaya is about 10 mins drive from my hotel near the beach road the shopping complex is huge in size and has some of the best brands to offer we were mostly attracted to high end brands of duty free cigarettes and
the krabi area does not seem to have numerous spectacular temples so why not stop briefly to see the imposing reclining buddha statue at wat sai thai which most tourists drive by on the road to ao nang
the landscape scene is a beautiful one a perfect location to view gods creation as always and everything simply awesome we spent time till 7 00 pm we actually got a complimentary free transfer to this view point from the hotel two villa holiday inn onyx style in
the light house views of the two beaches was incredible
the location on trip advisor led us to an abandoned temple we were chased and tainted by savage stray dogs please update the location on the map we found the place in the end

the most dangerous of the three waterfalls in koh kood the trek down is relatively easy compared to what is waiting for you next the only path to reach the waterfall is through climbing and jumping from one boulder to another it is very risky
the most developed beach of koh tao

the national park closed all driving the morning we decided to drive and i had to continue the next day to pattaya i will
the natural gateway to krabi
the nature and the amazing snorkel places with only few people but lots of fishes
the new paradise park
the newly opened suandok park building
the one day jungle tour which includes hot spring waterfall
the only downsite is that your not allowed to take pictures inside the temple it had such a beautiful wall painting but the outside wow the sculptures wow offcourse you must like this weird sculptering
the only location on the island to see the sun sink into the sea either from the beach
the only problem but not very serious was the water in the sea sometimes we had to walk farther into the sea to have a good swim
the only thing that stood out for me was the longtail boats and the islands close other than that restaurants have fresh sea food just like karon or kata beach and tuk tuk every where
the only thing to do on this island was shop i wanted to sightsee not shop panyee islam is a floating muslim town according
the orange boat ride offers a pleasant view of bangkok city if you are lucky to bag a seat instead of having to stand along the journey
the original tour operator of ayutthaya by river cruise good service with professional teams
the overall tour was slightly below satisfactory if anyone is planning a tour to james bond island with this tour agency i strongly recommend not to go with the minibus as the driver could not understand english which almost made us miss our ride to

the park has a large butterfly enclosure and beautiful landscape
the park is a large man made lake 200 x 800 metres situated next to queen sirikit national convention centre opened in 2002
the park is about half an hour away from bangkok city without traffic there is bikes for rent the park is about 500m round which is not too big entrance fee is a little too expensive but worth it
the park is old the amusement park machine is degenerated the water park is even worse no place to wash up and the changing place is partly opened the facilities are very old and damaged i can hardly recommend anyone to go if you want
the park is very small when we went there there was 4 adults and 3 babies all female they really seems to care about elephants an astonishing experience
the park view is not that good though this place is perfect for family come with children since there are kid park and few thrill ride but during my visit i find no any special show or event at
the park was amazing clean and tidy and just enough to entertain everyone highly recommend for family s looking for a day in the pool with a little extra all food and drink prices very reasonable
the park was big
the park was not well maintained in fact trash and garbage where
the people at yellow sbmarine were really awsome we were accomodated very well and felt so comfortable with this crew the dives were excellent and the staff was so knowledgable and helpful i have been to other good shops in phuket but none were as
the people that give up there time to look after these animals are amazing they are doing so much to help the animals on the island and also on the mainland
the phi phi island and the rest of islands around are beautiful and very nice but the guide
the phi phi viewpoiny offers a stunning view and is well worth the hike the hike is not intensive
the pier is well organized for speed boats to koh lipe there are speed boat companies at the pier we had to pay fees for the pier usage and the entrance to the ko tarutao national park
the pier was a bit deserted some tourists was seen boarding boats here for their island hopping
the place is definitely worth a visit for the majesty of the 90 meters buddha statue
the place is huge but not well kept we walked around the entire park and could see that it was initially very well planned but unfortunately
the place is not only a hiking and views story the forest
the place needs to get resources the place certainly has an important point towards our sea fish therefore 5

the rainbow fish divers are an amazing crew super professional and friendly instructors and fun to dive and just to hang out with in general the accommodation they provide is clean and like a small community of likeminded travelers the dive shop is surrounded by
the reason that the miniature of angkor wat have been presented here because during the reign of rama king iv or year 1851 1868

the reclining buddha is so big and colourful
the replica jade buddha and grounds were all worth taking in it was quite peaceful late in the day with monks cleaning and sweeping up given the jade buddha story this historic site

the scenery and be gentle in traffic after climbs and sharp curves and steep roads down you will discover the most southern beach from the road parc the bike
the sea is excellent when it was calm and fun most of the time with moderate waves however
the sea is very beautiful
the sea was calm which made for a smooth trip out to the small islands where we stopped for
the sea was full of jelly fish
the sea was really rough so no swimming today plenty of stalls on the beach to do shopping and also massage tables outside
the second buddha on the island with museum on the top with nice artifacts one of the statues is in a square with a bunch of bells that you can ring overall our most exciting adventure on koh samui overall

the staff is very friendly and very professional we did 6 dives here with some friends
the staff was very friendly the elephants are well kept highly recommended
the staff were absolutely great the food was good please remember you re in a tropical island

the stunning scenery views it was great to see the famous maya beach
the team at 9dee do a wonderful job at caring for the elephants
the temple appears with distinctive beauty
the temple between luxuries shopping mall i was there inside the temple for the first time in my life it was amazing with the garden of peace so clam your mild while traffic was so bad around the area just corn and making some merit
the temple grounds hold a night market on tuesday and friday nights from 4 10pm we visited initially on friday night but it was close to closing time
the temple grounds is a cheap but interesting place for a short visit the fish feeding is particularly child friendly
the temple housing one of the most revered lanna buddha image
the temple is amazing we loved the white temple
the temple is great and we were the only tourists there recommended
the temple is one of the landmarks of rayong
the temple is opposite the red giant swing and it is another royal temple this temple is massive but it is currently under renovation except for the main hall
the temple is very beautiful colourful architecture and plenty of gold
the temple is very colourful and at night quite a sight with all its lanterns and coloured lights it is however small
the temple of the golden buddha
the temple of the will power institut of a highly respected monk
the temple priests do not follow the agamas or
the temple was a little too quiet with no one around and not well maintained a steep walk up the hill with outstanding views overlooking the coast
the temple was planned during my stay in chiang rai easy to get too but run over by chinese tourists on every corner you are asked for donations
the temples
the temples are must see destinations in bangkok in addition to the cultural knowledge the tour provides you with enough information about the buddhist religious and the history of bangkok in general the negative side of the trip was the tour guide which did not
the thailand government has done an excellent job to maintain the natural environment this island and adjacent islands forms the marine national park of ko rang the coral reefs at ko yak lek is absolutely beautiful however
the tham phra nang nai cave is only a very short scenic walk from railay village plenty of monkeys to see on the way the cave has an entrance fee
the tiger god shrine is located at tanao road near the giant swing this is a teochew chinese taoist temple and houses statues of chinese supreme being
the tour guide i did the 7 islands and sunset tour and alibaba was extremely unprofessional and sexually harassed me and other women on not only our tour boat but other women on a different tour boat that stopped at the same places
the tour taxi boat of the river drops you about four blocks from it last stop on the river taxi as someone who has seen museums around the world
the tour to the emerald pool and tiger cave temple was well organised me and my boyfriend got a vip tour with an own driver and guide because the groupsize was 16 only 14 people can fit in a minivan the guide in our tour
the tour was amazing what i really liked was that we were a pretty small group the highlight were absolutely the elephants you had enough time to spend at every station and we got water and snacks from the guides khao lak tour plan did
the tour was conducted in english the places that we were brought was good we enjoyed the canoeing experience the lunch that was provided could have been better and the last island naka island
the tour was started off being 1595 baht 48 usd for phi phi island tour upon arrival to the pier we were sold more things we have to pay 200 baht for fins which should have been included and 150 baht for a new mouth
the trip itself start in chinatown from where you cycle to thonburi the former capital across the chao phraya river here you cycle along narrow alleyways and spend some time seeing religious buildings and get an overall impression of life in this chilled area of
the trip to james bond island was amazing
the trip to the four islands including simlian is well worth doing you are picked up a little earlier and get to the first beach before the other boats arrive it is worth it each drop off to the islands are so well organised
the two 5 star attractions were the james bond island and the hong island canoeing add to that the experience at the fishing village
the undersea walking is worth the money and so is para sailing and jet ski its all worth the money and not to be missed the only disadvantage is after the activity they leave in another island for 3 4 hrs before they get you back
the use of bull hooks by the staff indicates the abuse of these elephants in their infancy just the sight of the hooks is enough to guide these elephants
the veggie lunch was delicious and the staff were genuine and passionate with excellent attention to the elephants and guests we
the very friendly crew on this boat prepared a tasty and filling thai lunch as we cruised the river we enjoyed a two hour cruise after a full morning of seeing temples and palaces
the view is beautiful and there are many boats ready to take passengers at all times of the day just be careful not to venture out during rainy or windy weather
the view is exactly like the picture you see peaceful and calming and great view to sit and look at whilst eating at one of the many restaurants on the water good place to go and check out the night markets at too cheap street
the view is nice enough from many points but having to pay to look at it from a certain point is ridiculous what else they will find to get money out of tourists is there anywhere else in the world where they charge a sum of
the view on top of building was amazing which panorama view around you also staff was professional and politely especially thanks to khun dai he is the one to provided anticipatory service to all clients whoever visit here
the views are fantastic
the views are mostly ordinary generally not very crowded good to spend some time in the evenings
the views tower provides 360 view it is not a popular attraction point no much tourists here maintenance works can be improved
the vip james bond island tour was really great totally worth the money the whole day was well planned and executed speed boat was great the tour guides were nice and the main guide spoke good english the islands were amazing i have never seen such
the visit to the bridge on the river kwai was well worth the effort considering the australian association in construction of this historic war time relic floating markets were an experience
the visit to the sanctuary was the absolute highlight of my trip to thailand pure heaven for these two beautiful elephants
the walk in the bamboo forest was exhausting but a wonderful experience and the climb to the high khun korn waterfall exhausting but very worthwhile my guides were very attentive and extremely nice
the water at bamboo island is very clear like most beaches during the phi phi and four island tour they have areas specific for you to swim the corals are beautiful and so are the marine life too wish could spend more time there operators
the water is crystal clear and the reef is filled with beautiful fish the staff was very helpful since my group had four people who had never been diving so if you re a beginner or you re are just looking for an awesome place to dive
the water with 3 different shades of blue is simply stunning i cant wait to jump in the water the 2nd we landed in poda island we were among the 1st two grup reaching poda island that morning of 23 7 2019 which was on my bday
the waterfall and the tiger cave the tiger cave was in the middle of the jungle
the waterfall is a great excuse to get up early and drive into the mists and damp of phang nga on a weekend morning
the waterfall is in phanom bencha national park we had a rental car with us and it was a nice 40 mins drive from ao nang the whole place was well maintained there were reasonably clean toilets and changing rooms there it was a short
the waterfall is located north khao ra view point about 620 m up bring swimming gear
the waterfall was very picturesque there is a large pool for swimming and a decent path down from the parking lot the climb down is a bit steep
the waterfalls themselves are nice to look at although it is mostly rocks we trekked to the view point which was definitely worth going seeing as it was a great view quite a bit of walking is involved to properly check out the waterfalls view point
the weather and the view was incredible perfect to relax on boat and watch hua hin and later the other wishing boats friendly crew
the weather is quite well when i was there overall there is nothing special unless you like to play sports activities but if you prefer snorkelling
the weather was not good but fun experience nonetheless nice visiting beautiful sights around the island
the weather was veryyyy sunny but the sea was just great amazing team booked with diamnd sea marine co ltd
the wetzone dive boat is state of the art and very comfortable all gear is well marked and organized for each diver my husband and i did 4 dives with wetzone divers 2 at koh tachai and 2 at richelieu rock in both cases
the white temple is a must see but be advised that the road up there from chiangmai is under major construction the drive is just awful for close to an hour
the whole beach from chopsticks hill to the centara hotel is beautiful
the whole park is maintained poorly
the wife and i had an awesome dive with pablo to three dive spots he was super friendly and professional always making sure we were well informed and having a good time weather was gorgeous and even better were the dive shots pablo took for
the worst experience after travelling around thailand we paid 1200 baht for this trip and they promise us that we will visit at least 2 islands one of this monkey island and that we will be back around 4 30 pm but in stead of this
the worst robbery that i have witnessed in my travel life i don t understand how is this possible and how is this so called park farm still stands on a tourist list first of all
the young thai guy that worked there seemed like a cool honest guy 150 baht per day no liability for scratches either but just in case i took multiple photos of everything i could not return the scooter on my own because i had a dive
theatre and show both impressive think you would get a good view from most seats nice mix of traditional and more modern dance etc is a little way out and limited dining choices nearby
their quality but also about the environment and their place in society new heaven dive school ticked all these boxes and more we had the best week we could have imagined we
then a second river trip to the jungle
then also rafting and hiking up to the waterfall korn was a great guide informative
then did a walk with them through nature
then i recommend you do the bike tour of the koh yao noi island the hotel pickup was very prompt and i was greeted
then look down you will see that it is very beautiful the sea bottom is very deep the sea is dark blue and has
then lunch where the locals eat before seeing the best sights of the national park by car and trek and ending up making having coffee
then negotiated a price with a longtail boat visit several other beaches in the island nice sand several restaurants and fun bars
then this is the place for you it s on the beach front
then this is the place to go this sanctuary is ethical and the elephants are treated with respect
then this is the tour for you too little time was spent outdoors immersed in the culture the white temple is magnificant and should not be missed
then visiting secret buddha garden would definitely satiate your soul the garden holds a rich history and was established in 1976 by nim thongsuk who began by bringing various intricately designed sculptures to
then walking one to the river to wash
then was expected to pay 200 bhts each to see a natural waterfall
then went on and gave them a scrub and wash in the river and feeding them back to
then you will like this beach there is a rayong surf
there are 2 versions with regards to pregnant women some go to the shrine at the back of the wat near d river to pray for a smooth delivery
there are 3 bars eateries that front the beach and all are really good
there are a few temples on koh phangan and it is always nice to relax a bit
there are a lot of james bond island tours but this tour is hands down the best one
there are a lot of rocks and the sea is cut in 2
there are about 318 stairs up to the golden mount
there are also different sites with stories inside the temple
there are chains and they do go on trecks which are very damaging to elephants their backs are not built to have humans weight too sad for the elephants to be held by the ear to make them do what they want them to read
there are few hotels around this beach however
there are many massage shops two are on the riverside beside the temple nice river view and best price reclining buddha is there take a boat trip from saphan thaksin
there are many striking buddhist temples this temple is by far the most integrated with fabulous natural surroundings not too far from lamai beach
there are many wonderful buildings and monuments to see and photograph the entrance fee is 40 baht and is more than worth the price it was pleasant and busy even with steady rain i would definitely say to see this wat if you are only
there are much better bars on the island with much better views and prices also the 600m dirt track is atleast 1km long and inaccessable by motorbike waste of a energy for a hard
there are plenty of thai style restaurants on the beach front
there are restaurants on the beach and few across the road but not to many and i would call it a peaceful beach
there are ropes to grab on both sides of the steps to reach a wooden platform from there you would need to climb a few difficult rocks to finally reach the waterfall after this moderately
there are several people who are so important for koh chang they are trying to show you the hidden images of the island and make you love it forever these people are trying to present you the real non touristic reality and trying to keep it
there are several places to collect a long stick to keep the dogs from biting you just remember to put the sticks back for the next person the view from the top is very nice and worth the short walk from where you must leave
there are several restaurants mr swai from explorenique introduced us to the mae yui river cafe and it was such a delicious treat
there are surely better places to be when you re looking for a nice beach however
there are trails to follow in the park but not well sign posted
there is a big outdoor aerobic dance group for 45 minutes dance in the park with local runners onnthe 700 m
there is a boardwalk to this beach which seems private but to my knowledge beachfront cannot be blocked by private owners there is an accomodation here which run a small restaurant beach is very secluded and private though not as clean as rubbishes are washed
there is a hotel next to the park great place to go to
there is a place to view brilliant sunset by the beach
there is a road facing a row of restaurant with nice architectural design and nice view we kept walking and realised the
there is a sign telling you which exit and the temple is just right
there is an 11 foot tall buddha bronze statue covered with gold in the prayer hall the temple hosts a yearly ceremony
there is good snorkeling right off the main beach
there is no more bang bao beach it became the pier and walking street plaza there are two bang bao pier locations on google map
there is no riding or performing you get to feed the elephants
there is the white pagoda and the chapel inside the area tourist can make merit and donate to the temple as well
there s a lot of nice temples with different types of architecture we went inside most of them and they were pretty nice there is one temple that has a really unique top to it that i thought was
there was a gentle cool sea breeze and very few people on the beach the beach and sand was surprisingly clean
there was a lot of apprehension about a trip to an elephant sanctuary near chaing mai on arrival
there was nothing special or remarkable about this mosque except the location amidst natural beauties there were very few locals and a maulavi who greeted me
there were few attempt to make this beach cleaner
there were only two elephants in the sanctuary when we visited it
there were positives and negatives about this day firstly is it a cheaper option than many others and the food is good they provide breakfast tea coffee lunch and sea sickness tablets etc the boat is very slow like is the engine even on slow
theres only a small road that leads you to this chinese temple and there is a new building still under construction behind this current temple very nice scenery from the top level
these are rescued elephants that roam free fed bathed elephants lot of one on one with the elephants no riding here great trip staff was great
these golden buddha is incredibly amazing
these playing fields and public park
these poor elephants are stressed end gets beaten with sticks with iron hooks on them only ignorants will support this sort of animal cruelty
these waterfalls consist of no less than 17 sections circllng almost around the small mountain most people only walk a moderate climb on an easy path to waterfall one or two the locals use them for swimming or feeding the very abundant fish we climbed
they are a fun and professional team with a lot of attention to safety and customer service great dive equipment and boat
they are at least as good as the show in the jurong bird park in singapore it was most entertaining it has been said the
they are disappearing from the forests as people demand to keep them as pets the grp works to educate visitors about the horrible consequences of the pet trade while also trying to rescue and rehabilitate gibbons that have been
they are no longer around i tried island divers instead and did 5 dives in 2 days
they are the only diving center in koh tao that really cares about the sea environment and take care of it they do beach clean up every friday and you can volunteer and get a tshirt thanks to
they are very business oriented that is actually what i can expect in this too busy island tour is very nice it is so phi phi what
they arranged a separate dive master just for us two just
they call koh samet beautiful island and natural park but is just a joke not even go down from speedboat that a guy with military army dress stop me and ask to pay 200 baht because it is natural park than if you want live this
they do a brilliant job of buying elephants from owners that use elephants for logging and tourist businesses that are made to work in terrible conditions and treated badly and give them a wonderful retirement
they do not actually stop at this place but we can see it quite clearly while we pass alongside the clean water and mesmerising view is a take away from this place
they do not understand that we are here to have fun go to dive in a good place can be totally a bad day with displeasing instructors i do not recommend this diving club
they gave me a bcg which started self inflating when i was in 20m so i went straight up i complained about the deflator malfunction prior to the dive but the dive master convinced me that everything was ok i was in shock after the
they had a wonderful time and loved most parts there was some sections that were little scary however only short this park has 3 main sections
they have entertainment line up from the start which make the trip more fun you get island
they let the clients decide which dives to do if someone had a preference i would dive with them again
they offer amazing and diverse dives
they really take care of the elephants you can be with them the whole day the staff are absolutely amazing
they roam in the jungle freely here s the attraction part 1 elephant feeding boy did we all enjoy feeding
they still fool you around 40 50 meter means deep sea fishing i think you better learn from those captain in maldives
they still managed to take us out on two days of great diving everything was smooth and easy first day was to koh phi phi on a large and well organized dive
they then took us on a island hopping tour
they took us to the best secluded parts of chiang rai and surroundings they organised everything and knew the best places to eat or with the best views their english
third time staying here adang divers is just 1 min walk to beach peaceful and lovely snorkeling great sunrise cafe food is excellent
this a good organiser of tours in and around phuket the james bond island tour was well organised professional and the minibus picked up from hotel on time as promised the guide was very knowledgeable too and informed us the finer details of the various
this area is still being developed and that is its charm somewhat isolated and a bit off the track we went at low tide and the beach and sea did not look inviting merits a revisit though
this beach can look nice in photos and a lot of the boutique resorts in the area are nice but the beach is a real let down there is trash everywhere e v e r y w h e r e even our small hotel was throwing their trash on the beach the beach
this beach features easy access to the reef
this beach has a stunning reef at both ends i loved snorkeling and swimming here however
this beach has ideal for couples
this beach has some lovely views around it
this beach have the biggest gap from low tide to high tide during low tide is like a natural swimming pool is really unique go to spend one day there is really different beach
this beach is 2nd most crowded beach of koh larn there are numerous resorts where you may spend a night the beaches of koh larn ususally gey deserted by 6 00 pm as much of tourist come there for a day trip and return by evening
this beach is a little secret hideaway there were not many tourists when we visited may 2019 the beach also had a nice restaurant on the beach
this beach is a natural paradise buried in plastic bottles
this beach is beautiful
this beach is clean and quite this place is good walking the way to ban khai is very good there are many dogs and they are cute
this beach is close to but
this beach is closed of from chaweng in a way that you cant walk into town if you would like to at first i got frustrated becouse there is only a small river separating chaweng noi from chaweng and the big beach but after some time here
this beach is low key and quiet compared to haad rin the sand is soft and water is clear blue bring your own blanket and chair there are some spots away from hotels you can chill you can walk from the main area about 10
this beach is more like a harbor because you cannot swim in it there s a boardwalk that s lined with restaurants but it s very overpriced and you ll get a lovely view but don t look too close because you ll see trash floating about all over the place
this beach is never cleaned and
this beach is not easy to find
this beach is not for swimming its only for the tourists to get on the boat if you are not going for a boat trip

which it is but each is unique in their own way it was quiet on the day we visited so easy to view and enjoy so much elaborate work
which kata and karon beach are infested with it cost 500 baht for my partner and i to get to the hill above nui beach however he couldn t drive down the hill as it is not
which left very little time left to enjoy the view the food was awful and the 84th floor observation deck did not revolve
which made for a very soothing atmosphere there are
which seems to be every couple of years we also make a special trip to the hospital at lumphun to see how the injured elephants are faring this time we had four year
which the kids loved various cultural shows and the elephant theatre is so large
which was a wonderful place this time we stayed on another beach
which was awesome great landscapes
which was brilliant our guide host took us to the viewing platforms and took photos of us which was great very picturesque and beautiful colours the facilities at the bottom on the beach weren t
which was full of chinese turists we went to ao wai and it was perfect for our family with three children there was only one speed boat on the beach
which we could see from our hotel s beach a short speedboat ride away
which were both really kind and told us a lot about the dive site both of our fun dives were morning
while staying in ao nang we got made two suits and a ladies coat at sunny collection we received excellent service from garry with help to select fabrics and the fitting process garry was attentive to our feedback during the fitting we were very pleased
while walking to wat pho i happen to come across wat ratchabopit sathit mahasimaram some parts of the place is under renovation but the garden area is really well taken care of but it is a peaceful place to visit
whilst my friend and i were very sceptical about visiting elephant parks
whilst these people tell you that their elephants aren t ridden
white sand beach is by far the best beach around
white sand lots of restaurants on the sand as well as beach clubs where you can hire deck chairs and umbrellas for the day for around 300 baht quiet and reasonably clean
white sandy and soft sand beach quiet and white clear crystal water in the high season budget bungalow is all around
white temple and golden triangle tour and we got all of that was not our first choice but we ended up having a great day with our guide mumu and the food stops
who come to pray and make offerings there is a very quiet and traditional neighborhood just to the west as you head towards the river
who have been snorkeling for many years and sai daeng beach is perfect for that this year we wanted to try diving
who proposes original activities which combine cycling off the beaten tracks and paddling on the kwai river for very affordable prices all the members of troy s team were very nice
who wants to see a poor baby elephant who is clearly in distress and has obvious puncture scars the way this country treats its elephants is appalling anyone that visits and takes pictures of any baby elephant or takes an elephant ride in this country
who was cool and funny we only had 3 climbers total in our group so we never had to wait very long for our next attempt the weather and view
whoa the water was deep and it was so clean the beach is surrounded by rocky hills and palm trees it is a lot quitter than some of the other beaches on the island there is a really cool restaurant on top of one of
why i searched for it this is one of many bridges in bangkok which connect each side of the river it is impressive and shows that the thais do
why is this dive operation on trip advisor when it is not even exsisting i went on trip advisor to find a dive operation for when i came to kata beach when we got to the dive shop only to find it is no longer
why women must pay to access to a temple if they can t go inside it ticket office must advice it before selling tickets
why would anyone support a business that tortures baby elephants it was so heartbreaking to see a baby elephant chained up with wounds from those very chains he is so young and should still be nursing from his mother how shameful
wiang kum kam and all the nature around chiang mai we had a great mix
wicked diving no longer has an office in khao lak they are exclusively in indonesia now wicked acts as a booking agent for sea dragon
wide white sand beach
wild life and plants you view on the way to top is what we were looking for huge lizards
win win took us to some temples we had not yet visited and have us a thorough history of each sight he also took us to a couple street
wish could stay more were on the phi phi islands tour boat blue water white sand beach peaceful will be back again
with a big 11 ft high buddha and some lovely murals the nearby mondop is topped by a brilliant golden steeple and the exterior is exceptionally pretty
with a huge buddha in the main hall my wife and i immediately found peace when stepped inside the temple is made of woods
with a little worried that this trip would not worth the money spent same like the first time i went to phiphi island which was a disaster of everything
with a number of temples to see and not ordinary with many large statue monks
with all the party goers who flock to haad rin beach for the full moon parties
with beautiful mountain and river views there is a raft for accommodation on the water perfect for relaxing with friends or family can bring food to grill on the raft itself
with beautiful nature
with boats departing to the island all day
with daughter temples in canada at the time difficult to reach
with enough lighting to see different cave features and formations torch lights can be rented at the base
with good views located a bit far from the city center of hua hin have to use your own transportation to get here
with great views though it can seem short if you rush it so take your
with just enough cozy restaurants and some ok snorkeling very shallow and warm water thoug beautiful sunsets and a good evening vibe with several places to have dinner and drinks in a variety of lounges i would recommend choosing this beach if going to koh
with longtails and ferries to take tourists to railay beach and other destinations the street the fronts the beach is a long strip of shops
with lots of interesting plants and animals to sea staying at the bamboo homestays was wonderful
with nature all around
with nice staff and ok snorkling good food and atmosphere
with options of james bond island and phi phi islands
with our fantastic instructor mon from karstclimbingkrabi fantastic location on the beach no fear
with over 70 dive schools in the island it is not easy to find the right one
with sea access only small
with spectacular view a bit hard to get to
with the best beach in the whole krabi aonang province take a private speedboat trip early
with the friendly dogs seeking for a pat on their head we also managed to catch the sunset while walking to
with white beach and jelly like water to play around also a shame indeed for me not booking the racha hotel with my wife trip was a 9 for everything except we not seeing
within easy riverside walk from wat arun
without a doubt my favourite part of two weeks backpacking around thailand we fed and bathed the elephants
without a doubt this is the elephant experience you will want to have in thailand in july my family of four two teens and parents spent an incredible day taking care of two elephants for the day we fed
without any interest except that of realizing that it had no interest spot for digestive walk and the final photo to the beach
without specific expectations we started our 3days jungle trip with our guide sun we visited three various tribes
wonderful and seducled beach one of the best beaches in phuket if not the best one access by boat from surin beach less than 5 minutes 200bhat person both ways around 20 people or less maximum in the beach so it was like a private beach
wonderful day out with khampan rafting with yu and his team really fun and safe rafting trip down the river with our raft captain mike very safe trip with full briefing and lots of staff positioned on the river in and out of rafts for
wonderful dive center in phuket easy hotel pickup in patong and great day of diving with simon i was able to do some nice nitrox diving
wonderful experience our first liveaboard friendly and helpful staff great diving including nitrox fernando was a fine dive leader and fun to dive with 4 dives per day good and plentiful food comfortable rooms need to be fit for the experience
wonderful experience visiting this holy temple
wonderful island to visit i recommend chartering a private longboat for the day and exploring the island and the many beaches go early in the morning to avoid heavy congestion from phuket based tours
wonderful jungle experience be ready for 30 minutes climb in jungle
wonderful place to take in all the natural views offers lots of options
words and pictures can not describe how amazing this place is the people are so lovely and are fantastic with the animals the elephants are so tame and kind this is a must do will treasure every moment
words cannot describe how amazing the green island bike tour adventure is with v he is so knowledgeable and makes you feel very safe riding around the busy bangkok streets i have not ridden a bike in years i am 30 so not comfortable on a bike but
worst experience ever i emailed the company a week before to confirm my hotel pick up and they said yes they claim free hotel pick up if in patong beach
worst experience ever we booked the 5 island tour 1 not a traditional thaiboat at all it was old and broken 2 hidden prices need to pay 120 baht more for insurence at the pier after that
worth a visit if you appreciate religious sites and the uniqueness of a golden temple we did a private driving tour of the south west of koh samui
worth the walk to this beach just need to register at the guard shack when entering the base very quiet when we were there clean and really nice sand
would definitely recommend this day well organised and staff were friendly matt was a fantastic guide throughout the day lots of refreshments given to keep you cool the island stops were brilliant
would highly recommend this tour so much to do a real jungle trek and get to shower under a real waterfall then we went kayaking
would love to have seen the waterfall on a sunny day
would not call this tour a proper tour the tour guide just held a book with times on it telling you when you were to be back at the bus monkey cave nothing great just monkeys outside and unsafe steps to walk up and down in
would recommend highly the elephants are in paradise beach now and not tri trang however the employees are very friendly and will even take photos for you for a fee maybe 6 elephants total but all very well looked after and happy
would recommend them for a dive in pattaya we went to the far islands for 2 dives
would say that this temple is off the usual tourists  list
wouldn t recommend visiting this place they are elephants witch you can ride on their back this is very bad for them
wouldn t recommmend this tour with anyone you think your booking for a half day trip at coral island but not only do they pick you up later 1 hour late they take you to this port in the middle of the ocean for other people
wow amazing full day spent at this wonderful elephant sanctuary i couldn t recommend this enough firstly
wow tours are a great way to get an idea of everything the little island of koh tao has to offer i took part in their full day tour
wuttikrai led a wonderful ride through the rural areas just outside krabi and ao nang it was great to see the real countryside we stopped and spoke with a farmer tapping rubber trees and a longboat operator repairing his boat we enjoyed coffee at one
ya know i never believe the saying sh t happens everywhere until i saw my phone drop right into the sea
yeah maybe just another of soooooo many temples and religious sites around thailand but the fact that you most likely will not stumble across too many tourists here and the sheer beauty of the place is well worth the slight detour of ah2 on your way
yes it is overpriced for what it is you can t compare it to the gold coast but something like water bomb park in bali is far cheaper and
yes the way up to the big buddha was steep and quite demanding but we mostly walked up a concrete road
yesterday i spent one day with my wife on a sail boot around an island nearby pattaya as a snorkeling addict
yesterday we returned from an action packed adventure with mr tu s team to anthong national marine park after having our first trip cancelled with a different provider don t go with the guide top
yesterday we saw paradise coral beach in koh phangan what a beautiful gift from mother nature for sure a lifetime experience and a true ultimate destination if you already have your bucket list in place add this one unfortunately this beautiful scenery is polluted by a little
yesterday we visited this elephant sanctuary from nature i am skeptical of places were animal are kept in captivity and i am totally against using animals for tourist entertainment however this sanctuary is one of the best you can get if you want to experience
yet it was a nice place to stay right in front of a small beech
yoga at 9 am every day chill the rest jog or gym work out in the evening rent mats have a drink love this park
you are a great teacher and protecter all the time you meet us a day before dive to tell us every detail you take us from the hotel to the boat you helped us to get use to the gears and position and you
you are going to be at the phuket aquarium the location has a really well constructed deck across the seashore road you are able to have a 180 degrees view
you are pick up from hotel the trip takes about 30 minutes first stop is elephant ride 30 minutes ride into jungle you do not go that far just round in a circle you handler will take photo for you trip they is an official photo
you can call it beach
you can call it pier is just and urban beach dirty sand and water
you can choose your own lobster fish from a tank and have it cooked we stayed in a villa in the sea breeze resort 5 mins walk away
you can enter without a guide and you are welcome to do so it might seem intimidating if you ve never entered a sikh temple
you can find a limestone waterfall in the cave just like the wang sai tong waterfall but the there is no more water flowing
you can find this boat shaped temple near the sathorn pier it was built during the ayutthaya period as the city grew so did the temple the trade between siam and china kept expanding and by king rama iii s time the traditional chinese junk boats
you can have a nice view of chaopraya river and the classic neo thai architecture you will learn about the history of
you can have excellent view charge is bit more
you can see sea
you can see the waterfall and also go to the view point and look the sea from there also you can continue walking and see a lot a lot more smaller waterfalls it s a nice hike but not super easy maybe it s better
you can see this masterpiece on the right bank of chao phraya river this group of structures
you can skip this spot as this is mostly enjoyed by locals nothing very majestic just highlands with some waterfalls and temple
you can take the brt route where the bus would stop right opposite the entrance of the temple and it might not be the
you can truly enjoy the beauty of the beach there were
you can use the boat to go to this buddhist temple it is the terminal station of the khlong saen saep express boat service the temple is open air so it feel very easeful it is funny with some fortune tells around the temple and
you cannot appreciate the emerald buddha through pictures or description it is both beauty and experience wrapped into one event
you cannot drive tot he beach
you could enter the sea there
you enjoy photos with different cheerful colors and different buddha
you guys cant afford to miss this one at least they have different stages of the waterfalls
you had to park by the road side the market
you have a nice view which also overlook the samui airport
you have to pay 100thb to enter the deck for view so make sure you have it
you have to pay an entrance fee for its national park area there are several boat service
you have to pay an entry fee into the area i think it is 100thb and then trek up to the viewpoint
you have to walk a long ways out to be able to swim bay was very calm the entire time i was there water taxis call into several stops along the beach
you ll have to pay 300baht pp for a return boat which is only a 5 minute journey to the island
you ll stop by at ko wua talap island beautiful scenery
you may be able to see turtles and lots of different fish viewpoint can get very busy and takes a long time in qeues
you may stop by this temple and visit this temple has a petite white buddha and white stupas which is different than other temples and also the 52 bhikkhunis it is definitely worth a visit
you may take cable car to see another temple on top of another mountain
you may take the lift to guanyin s forehead to enjoy the view since this place is a complex
you must go to phuket and phi phi the most incredible views
you need to enter 100baht to enter the viewpoint and take a 25min hike to get there which i really enjoyed the viewpoint is beautiful totally worth it would recommend wearing closed shoes when doing the hike and go for a swim at the freedom
you night see sharks you might not so we said when would be best later maybe sunset he said yeah better chance at
you should come here to see golden mountain at the top and see bangkok city note that you should wear polite before visiting
you should know that the only access is by taxi boat or by foot few hours hike through the mountains from haad rin beach is very beautifull and quiet
you should not miss checking in at nui beach after a little adventurous hike along a path through small tropical jungles bit
you try to go to the temple and a guy approach you telling you it s closed at that time and arrange
you walk stairs up to the temple not long at all it is very beautiful from outside i did not go inside because i did not have suitable clothing you should take clothes to cover up if you want to go inside it is free
you will appreciate the best beach of samui
you will be happy with our bunch we had an amazing time here very friendly staff thank you chin for taking such good care of us they treat the elephants with respect and it was a wonderful experience truly a family of people who care about
you will get some river water splashes look out for

you will really enjoye this beach if you love quiet beach
you will see all the secret part of the island for people who likes explore the island and get the best viewpoint that is the walking track to book
you would get almost all species of sea food here vendors make it fresh on order basis best i get is coconut ice cream
you wouldn t want to go to any other sanctuary than this our number one priority when searching was to make sure the elephants were treated as good as possible and received the care needed the signs leading in instantly have in big bold letters saying
your usual beach the water is murky
a beautiful and relaxing location to go fishing for large freshwater specimens add to that the wonderful landscaped environment
11 and 9 and felt happy leaving them with an instructor to snorkel while we
13yo and we had a ball it was great to get up close with the animals pat the deer
16 14 this was our first scuba diving experience and we all thoroughly enjoyed the day parents were not required to come along
2 adults and 1 12yr old who are fairly new to diving from start to finish the process was flawless
2 mackerels and a couple of smaller tuna thanks to tobin for an awesome fishing experience
4 of us making the open water diver certification course and the other two making some fun diving without doubt
4 of us with diving licence
4 predator rods 2x arapaima a dozen red tail and thai thail catfish 1x huge chao prayer catfish lots of pacu and im sure when you start to forget what you have caught it was a good days fishing
a booking was made for 6 of us to go fishing all of us are quite experienced fisherman at home and so thought it would be something different but unfortunately we only trawled for fish
a grand exhibition of animals trained to entertain people over a 90 minute showcase my kids aged 6 and 3 where left a little scared at time kids left feeling sad there is a silly process of handing over your mobile phones for storage during
a holiday combining scuba diving and yoga was my dream
a must visit in phuket for the adventure seeking people atv vehicles are available for single and 2 persons one only needs primary knowledge of driving the vehicles are very stable and the center of gravity is at a low height an instructor leads you to show
a safari room is drew with full of different animals thirdly
absolutely recommendable kitty tells so vividly and in good english she arranged a snorkel trip for us here were thai s who were guides a absolutly great experience to a not crowded place the mangroves
absolutely the best experience i could have had for my first time diving matt and mark were so professional and welcoming to the world of diving i cannot recommend tigerland scuba enough
acdc diving is a great diving school they gave me a new
actually getting on the liveonboard on the mv bavaria and doing the scuba diving made all the initial annoyances worth it i booked with the company directly instead of another site like liveaboard com or padi travel which i have heard can be a hassle too
after a break of almost five years we did scuba diving again i wrote to some diving centres before and got compared to others a very comprehensive
after an abstinence of 18 years from diving
after years of wanting to try free diving i decided to give it a go after completing my open water course with big blue i can safely say it is one of the best things i have ever done jp was perfect from the start and the
air conditioned transfers from chiang mai very thorough safety briefings on arrival during activities atv 3 hour trip such fun if like me you don t want to drive your own vehicle you can sit on the back with one of the guides some of
also best diving boat in koh tao highly recommended
although it s supposed to be zoo but not many animals are present and that too not very well maintained aquarium was also too small and a normal species only since we didnt have anything to do on a very hot day we took our kids
although we had our diving course with another company
always have such a great time visiting friends at scuba dawgs amazing staff and top notching diving highly recommneded
amazing experience i had with them the whole team is very professional and dedicated to all the requirements you might need starting from the very beginning till the end they take complete care of you this was my first diving session but i felt completely comfortable
amazing experience many endangered species and was wonderful to get up close and personal with them all animals appeared very well fed
amazing landscape
amazing marine life and joerg as a instructor showed us scuba diving is safe and a lot of fun you like you have a good expirience go to seafrog multilingual instructor team thanks a lot
an excellent diving club
an introduction to offshore fishing steve and his team of mr kim
an overwhelmingly wonderful few weeks of diving and learning i was lucky to already have a limited knowledge of reefs from working with and keeping aquariums
and 1 star for the snorkel experience
and answered all my emails and questions there were many promptly and courteously similan diving tours was also great for early bird and last minute discount
and brought our cousin to jalapeno diving for her to try diving for the first time we are already certified thanks to manu and his patience
and comes with live local band only avail on sat evening seafood is freshly arrived from fishing boat nearby and prices are mainly local good food
and even though the weather could have been better and the diving with better conditions due to rain
and great choice for something to do to get away from the diving for a few also a super fun rain day activity since the wall is indoors they are opening a getaway climbing camp soon too
and i highly recommend using them for your diving excursions while in the area
and is more of a circus than a zoo very few animals in small enclosures
and me out fishing for a half day trip and we caught 4 mahi mahi great experience and a very knowledgeable captain i would recommend him to anyone looking to have a fun fishing trip
and most animal welfare conscious
and now we had two days of fun diving with their phuket crew i did the booking day before via chat on their facebook
and one of our buddies mentioned why not go fishing for a change we all agreed and called our agent to hook us up for a fishing trip on the
and was amazed at the excellent diving millions of fish
and we were able to learn so much about these incredible animals
and wow all the animals were kept in tiny containers cages with barely any water
animal cruelty the cages and pits are to small for the animals water is just a little puddle of filthy water
animals are treated badly
anyone wanting to go on a fishing charter in thailand look no further alex was great to deal with and him and his crew were absolutely amazing we went in the low fishing season and alex made no promises but they still got us into
as a diving novice was very lucky to have michael
as a group of 2 we did the 2 day open water diving course
as a newbie to fishing
as i was terrified at the thought of doing scuba diving matt is very patient
at least they should have fan looked as if they are transporting animals not worth for the money spent
atv
atv quad bike mate it was sooo fun but a little bit dangerous because you can hit anything very rough terrain if you hit a tree it will cost you 5000 baht which is 235 aud i fell off a lot because it was
atv rides
atv tour booked for 90 minutes
awesome diving
awesome is the word in my head throughoht my tour i went solo and communicated with the owner a really cool guy who designed the electric atv and run the business all on his own in advance on what type of experience i wanted the
bang po is also a popular fishing town
because i thought this beautiful country is not exactly world class in terms of diving i was wrong alice
been out to mike baileys eft fishing twice now last visit feb 19 while we were out there for our 30th wedding anniversary
best diving company in the world
bf and i just did our advanced diving certification with chang diving we had undivided attention from our diving instructor pern he was professional
booked a snorkeling and then fishing trip through this company both were absolutely excellent after having an amazing time snorkeling decided to book a day fishing trip through them brilliant staff all really friendly and willing to help and have a chat they even made
brenda and alex are so lovely and helpful i did 4 days diving with them which was amazing and very well organised then my husband
but golfing is not my thing so i want to try diving
but i did not expect to see such a badly maintenance zoo the animals are very thin
but i only go diving every few years so do no have much experience during the day i
but i will never forget my first diving experience here it was a brand new world and so exciting to explore highly recommended
but that is fishing the world over the new salas are really comfortable with a good range of tackle and bait and the system of drawing for swims each evening
but to make the handlers look cool it was not a place for animal lovers to go
but worst of all no water findable in the cages of the animals
calm and patient under him my confidence at diving grew and i improved another instructor i had was louis
came to pattaya and went diving with nick great guide
cannot quite agree with them in my eyes the animals look quite well looked after and not fearful the trainers are very patient and gentle with them our kids loved playing with the younger monkeys which seemed to have
canoeing and then after atv riding
captain and the crew this fishing trip feels so pure and real it is a real fishing boat selling the fish
charm churee had some of the most service set staff we met on our vacation our diving coach helped us with everyting we needed and thought us many important things about diving he also made sure everyone were feeling comfortalble in the water and pushed
chaweng lake exists purely to supply water to the surrounding area there are no watersports or fishing activities on the lake except for the occasional local fisherman
cleanliness and compassion of this not for profit animal sanctuary a real must see whilst in phuket
could not fault the zip lining itself so would give 5 stars for that however do not expect great things for the lunch and the zoo is very sad and disappointing the animals don t have much space despite the zoo being very spread out if
couldn t have found a better instructor place to try the beginner diving course perfect for those trying to figure out if diving will be something you like spoiler you will like it and if you want to decide on getting certified huge thank you
deep diving and dpv all in 1 week neil is nothing less than charming

diving guide and istructor
diving here was one of best experiences of my life i have dove 55 times mainly in the caribbean
diving in 20 different countries the hat yai divers as i found out they could be called are one big family of relatives from southern thailand
diving with this guys in thailand was one of the best experiences in my life they are really friendly and professional
do it here that is what i am going to tell all of my friends from now on i feel extremely grateful that i ended up doing my ow here it was my first diving experience ever
do not go animals were treated badly you pay 400baths just to see how animals suffer crocodiles just wanted to get away no matter how much they tried to tiese them
do not visit this so called monkey school rather than pumping money into an organisation which makes its money thru torturing of animals
don and his team is professional and well organised was our first snorkling trip and was great we were well looked after and given enough opportunity to snorkel and enjoy the beautiful corals and sealife
done my open water diving course with these and was told a couple of months after completion i would receive my licence 14 months an still no licence plus no response from company
done scuba diving was a great experience steve and vittali was amazing people to deal with 100 satisfaction guaranteed
during the tour i was overwhelmed by this place the love and care they show the animals was just a bit too much and i could not keep it together we walked dogs and got a tour of the place such amazing work every animal has
each occtopus has its own diving computer small diving groups and taking care of you
earning money from other creatures sufferings horrible place poor animals it is like an evil circus of no emotions
either dipping our toes into diving or on their many trips we had a fabulous time key highlights were the owd course with sandra
english and more a big advantage are the small diving groups which make it possible for
especially for the person who like fishing the bungalow is nice also the food we had an experienced to caught many big fish until we got our arm and back ache
everyone s kind we were very fun i enjoyed diving the lunch was very delicious the scenery was beautiful
excellent day tour of the phi phi islands i felt like we hit all of the main attractions and i could not believe the beauty of the landscape the phi phi islands are crowded in general because of the number of companies running tours there
excellent diving at similan and surin national parks west coast divers had busy season behind and tiredness started to show but this being said
excellent experience four diving days with nld in june 2019 this is my third time diving with nld gary
first and foremost the website says they do not offer animal trekking
first time diving was pretty scary but our instructor
fish to feed and animals around i probably spent 20 minutes or more walking around
fishing amazing and our guide
fishing stations and the wild bird habitat etc it was out of this world
for the first time diving he was very nervous
free food i would never been scuba diving before and they made it a ton of
freedom dolphin diving by far has the most comfiest and luxurious scuba diving boat to date in phuket with exceptional food and great diving guides 10 10 would recommend
fresh food on board the diving instructor is very attentive leading is great beautiful scenery phuket racha yai perfect trip will choose again racha yai
friendly and genuine we first booked a snorkel tour to the surin islands
friendly yard with loads of animals roaming around wanting to meet you emma is very experienced
friends and i recently chartered the queen marlin with captain zao for a fishing day trip and had a really fun day we caught 6 tuna and a sailfish my husband and i have chartered boats all over the world and this was
full of animal skins and horns a little disturbing and definitely not the usual kind of tourist destination i visited with my wife and we found it creepy and morbid not my cup of tea at all but i am sure there are some
funny and dedicated to their job they are thorough on safety and only let you ride the atv when they are sure of your capacity to operate the equipment i did the tour with my mum 70
funny and professional they showed us the astonishing underwater world and afterwards explained us the different animals with their behavior from the first minute we felt great taking care of
genis and azul are all very professional and friendly thank you for great diving experience
gibbons are amazing animals but sadly
give you a lot of precious advices and she s so nice i enjoyed every seconds diving with her the
giving you strong skills regarding safety and environmental consciousness on top of diving basics

perfect experience i made snorkel for first time with them and it was perfect very good routes
personally i hated every minute on this course 18 holes of water everywhere and a flat boring landscape buggys that could not drive on the fairway which made them a complete waste on money i think this course is built for very short hitters or
plastic stopped our boat twice due to snags 2hrs fishing tops 2hrs out
please don t waste your time going on this trip the brochure totally misleads in regards to what you actually get boat is very old and slow fishing equipment was inadequate and only a very small amount of time was spent actually fishing the group consisted

some of these animals are intelligent and they have been locked up for 30 years disgusting

the lake has 11 fishing
the people there are doing an amazing job helping the stray animals in the area get healthy
the show was not made to showcase the beautiful animals
the show was short and i really did not like the way the animals were treated there for sure
the slide and diving board were both

this boat trip was fantastic fun traveled with my husband and 2 teenage daughters in september the staff were great and very interactive with us there was plenty of time to swim or snorkel at a few different places or just sit back and relax
this experience although short was one to remember for a life time the animals are very well cared for and staff are very good with them made our vist one to remember and were given all the information required
this is a beautiful spot for diving went here with aussie divers water is teeming with life it is a 1 5 hour boat ride out from chalong pier a nice way to spend the day except to be gone from 8 5
this is a really bad place for the animals do not go here do not support this place it smells really bad and all the animals are held in small dirty concrete cages the tourist are allowed to tease the animals by giving them food with
this is a tough one and think you need to make your own choices and review the human race will always want to see beautiful animals up close but doing this when they are in captivity will always be wrong whichever you look at it
this is a truly horrible experience the animals are clearly suffering and very
this is lovely cove that is a popular place to swim and snorkel there were lots of boats

this is the same place as shark bay trip advisor should merge the reviews i was too harsh when i rated this bay with only 3 stars last time i was on a snorkel trip and our boat stopped way out in the water and
this might just be the place we are always worried about places like this and have seen terrible animal slavery in other places
this month i had the pleasure of travelling to koh tao with a friend we wanted to get our open water licenses in koh tao but did not know which school to choose luckily we stumbled across pura vida by chance diving with these guys and

brilliant place to chill after a whole day of traveling street food just by the beach mats and tables are provided just by the sea wall how could you not love savoring the freshest grilled seafood and hearing the waves crashing beside you the cool
brilliantly crafted silverware and beautiful gem stones made into jewelry at an interesting all wood made type of shop we found it easily as it was located in front of the big shopping mall in the center of chaweng ask to see the owner s collection
bring good shoes
brought in a beloved unlined jacket of mine to be shortened a rather difficult alteration but they did an excellent job
bsnks that will exchange on saturdays sundays third floor central food court cafeteria
buddy tailor has a very friendly vibe clothes are authentic and quality over quantity on the busy street in bangkok
business dresses and blouses recently we went to a the rcl s red carpet event dolly tailored a 1920 s
busy enough to keep you entertained there are quite a few restaurants in the vicinity and shopping galore
busy night market serving very very special thai cuisine
but after a few minutes with anu the proprietor decided to get couple of trousers and shirts done the products
but almost nothing to do the same to adults probably the most boring mall in pattaya
but also a kind of market
but also jacket and trousers good range of fabrics and prices good standard quality just remember to take full advantage of the fittings offered
but also took the opportunity to walk around the mall it is a decently enough place
but amazing quality nice and charismatic employees with talent for sales and handcrafts we bought a suit and a dress and we are very satisfied with the result
but big enough the central department store is full of sparkle and eye candy prices a bit high there are many restaurants all this is refreshing however
but bob s was by the far the best shop and it was not even close in reality
but deffinetly worth it wear proper shoes and bring lots off water with you
but entrance to the market includes a boat ride around all most
but extra happy with this tailor and their work quality jackets
but finally we bought a couples of shirts
but have been consistently going to ravi the last 3 years efficient and honest tailor they may not be the cheapest
but have ordered during their home visits just received my second batch of 4 white ceo shirts
but he turns out great work almost all the tailors i met in bangkok and i went round about fifteen shops before i started getting stuff made i had plenty of time in the city
but i also suggest you to stop and have lunch in this was colorful and clean market it offers a
but i decided to buy a few more shirts and trousers while i again was in bkk for vacation good service and
but i did it myself and these people are quite friendly and hospitable leave your shoes at the vestiary and
but i doubt it best go for rod fai night market
but i have to say that the night market was a sad experience it was dirty
but i would like to talk about lunch and shopping the all seasons place is a great place for both affordable lunch at the food courts
but if you are looking for a great market
but is relatively upmarket good place for shopping
but it has the feeling of a quiet oasis these days it s difficult for any bkk high end shopping mall to distinguish itself gaysorn suffers a bit from this challenge however
but it is all takeaway hardly any seating it is an authentic thai night market
but it is quite beautiful do take drinking water if you head into the trail ways good walking shoes are a must flip flops are not a good idea
but johnny made shirts from his measurements when we returned home
but looks more like the souvenirshop in a themepark the usual touristic t shirts
but lots of plastic garbage is under the trees bring shoes for swimming
but may be one of the best tailors in bangkok i have used them and others for years and put quite a shilling there the quality of the work has always been to high standards and a few special garments they made for me
but mr armon guide me which is the best suit for me made 3 shirts and 1 suit it is very funtastic birthday present for me
but newman had left me with a sour taste after getting 3 shirts and 2 pants made there there was an indian staff who was rather unfriendly and just shoved the clothes up in front of
but not great either close to central world easy 10 minute walk bars are in the back of the market and numerous food stalls in the center area the 3 or 4 biggest all seemed to have the same menu but decent selection
but not so fantastic if you are looking to do some shopping go to mbk
but not sure why this is called  grand  for a start it actually has no central department store
but not too challenging restaurant pro shop is ok bring your own clubs as rental clubs are old especially for ladies
but only 10 minutes by taxi from mo chit bts if you want to see a market in bangkok which is not a tourist market but a place where thai people come to eat and shop
but otherwise nothing floats just another bargaining market
but remember to dress respectfully
but so glad my brother and i were able to stumble upon krishnas shop on our way to
but the jeans were not obviously jeans are not their fort in summary go there for shirts
but the market outside is very interesting especially at night it is a whole new experience
but the stalls are great a lot of clothes though but the stall holders are really nice and you don t have to bater a lot we got really ripped off with the price of our taxi
but the vegetarian food court had closed a couple months ago still some other related businesses seem to be open
but then i met pk they took the time and gave me perfect advise the suits and blouses were perfectly tailor made when i
but then i walked into martin s tailor alex made the entire experience a breeze very professional in his approach
but there is a shop in ao nang collected on time from hotel for short drive to beach to catch a longtail to the dive boat nice
but think that i was treated well at a fair price i had a jacket made and 8 9 shirts of which all are cut well and the workmanship seems better than my last tailor
but this was a nice little night market in town good amount of options for market food
but walking around the village with our guide was very educational the floating soccer field and the story behind it was interesting the market has a few unique hand made things
but was allured by the inexpensive clothing i came across dave s fashion on the street near khaosan road
but we were originally going to another tailor when we first came here
but went out with 5 shirts
but were disappointed as they had ceased the floating market a few months ago only a normal marker
but when i saw the quality and fine work of kumar on the dress shirts and suit my husband was having made
but when we arrived they informed us that this place was closed apparantly they don  t organisme this market anymore
but with large areas devoted to mobile phones mingling with fast food premises but there are numerous high stores as well and
but you will be disappointed if you come to do some normal shopping it is just across from platinum
by far my favorite shop and my favorite cloths
by far the best tailor in town would not go anywhere else my friends and i came in and were treated like family
by our opinion best tailor in hua hin good price excelent material and work we can recommended just nearby grand centara hotel in hua hin on the route to the beach hua hin

especially not for travellers with fixed timelines they have absolutely no respect for time my shirts were delivered two days behind the time we agreed upon even then i had to threaten a sit in before they delivered
especially the exclusive range of printed blazers and cotton shirts the behaviour of the shopkeeper and his staff was quite appreciable and they tried their best to show me all the variety they housed
especially with chinese tourists who go to tick it off their list hundreds of stalls selling variety of t shirt s and other tourist stuff lot less designer knock
etc that are sold everywhere in cm the cheap food and massages add to the fun but the market

it s an amazing shopping centre no doubt however getting out using a taxi is a nightmare they have what i would suggest is a karaoke singer coordinator who inflates the frustration by speaking to you into a microphone and announces to the waiting line
it s just another mall to be honest could be thailand or anywhere else in the world still worth a visit though
it s my favorite night market the fruit vendors will peel melons
it s not different than neighboring central mall
it s not easy to find something that fits me the tailor was super respectful
it s not popular place for tourists to go if you aim to buy souvenirs and shopping
it s quite challenging in parts and has many exciting zip line sections make sure you wear sports style clothes and don t do it really hungover
it s surprisingly nice to see the street art in the old town of songkhla worth visiting when you are there
it so happen to be nearby my recent accomodation still as usual you can find major brands in the mall
it took me some time to write this review i came back from a business study trip from thailand on september 7th this year i intentionally did not want to buy taylored clothes in bangkok but when i slendered through mbk s fashion level i was addressed
it was a 25 min drive to the market good food
it was a challenging climb down and then back up but it was beautiful and lovely to swim in but you do need decent shoes we saw lots of people turn back because they did not have covered shoes you do not need
it was a great experience getting my suit tailored at charles armani friendly and efficient

it was tailored specifically to our needs
it was worth a visit so variety of unique handmade product of traditional textiles nice and charming craft shop in the centre area of chiangmai
it will die out but it is not the chinese tour groups have totally destroyed this market and the shopping mall next
its a good place to shopping
its a market nearby students area variety choices of food and souvenirs quite cheap compare to other market since it is students area
its a nice place for those who wants to buy small electronic goods it is just next to platinum plaza

leave a little tummy space for the yummy food here at krabi weekend night market we had bamboo cocktail at thb170
led by wut who also holds classes in watercolor painting this is not an art shop like so many others that feature the same elephants
less visited this wonderful museum it was recommended to me by my private driver on a tailored half day tour phuket taxi lady and what a great suggestion it was indeed this place is
let me start by saying the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful i normally pay several times the price for tailored shirts from hong kong so it s difficult and possibly unfair to expect the same quality standards from mike s tailors however
let us face it most of us buy our clothes off the rack with superficial tailoring
like one stop shop for souvenirs has good collection
like the service given by the tailors customizing to our needs the service provided has been great and they all have been very patient

no more puppet shows at all we tried to buy tickets online and couldn t went in person to the theatre and there wasn t anyone there a man at the store across the aisle said they stopped the shows completely 6 months ago not even in

no rental shop

nonglak was a great guide she tailored the evening to allow us to explore the street food scene
nongmon market was local and also travel lover all time
not a floating market at all we went on a wed morning at 10am and almost 90 of the market is closed there won t any boats in the river and just plenty of stalls selling local food and crafts small area made up of temples
not a huge mall but this mall do often have branded sales clearance like fila roxy triump and etcs some eateries in this amarin plaza if you have extra time to go around there are small drug store and beautrim all beauty products you may able
not a market and not floating v basically food stalls next to one of the klongs avoid at all costs
not a pushy salesmen which makes the process enjoyable good quality shirts which fit well
not as exciting as the prominent night markets but the fame is due to its airplane located within the park not so recommended to visit in the evening if you are looking to shop but there are many interesting art spaces
not bigger than other market
not easy to find this market but glad we did super good tasty delicious food market close at 2 pm
not fantastic for the price you pay however my wife ordered three shirts and one skirt and jacket decidedly average and not a great experience
not like all the other annoying tailors in bangkok
not much shopping to do unless you want t shirts with phucket written on it
not much thing to do not much shop are open only some poppular bar that are crowded with people can take a purple line mrt bangson station
not much you can expect cos it is cheap food court is at level 6 buy coupon at the counter and can get refund if not used up all
not my place but i understand that given phuket airport is smaller and also people may not have much time inside for shopping
not only do my shirts look great
not only in price but the quality of the items tailored 2 suits 2 shirts done completed within a remarkable 3 days period with no compromise of quality workmanship comes with a great
not sure how this place gets these rave reviews i had 2 pairs of suede shoes made here 4 months ago and they have been very disappointing the quality was not brilliant when i picked them up and since then they have got worse the stitching
not sure of the company s name but we had a great day first by visiting a local market smells and all then onto a monkey temple and then a waterfall that was not late in season
not that exciting to shop here
not the best of markets but if you combine it with it is good bars and food then it is well worth a visit a good combination of shopping for souvenirs and a great night out
not to be negative but i dont feel its worth going out of the way to visit the kwan riam floating market there is really nothing to see nor experience the stores are all on land and the only floating part a the boats moored
not to forget his valuable advices he made me two tailor made suits and four shirts in a very short time and at
not too crowded them the market has anything and everything you can imagine the vendors are very nice and enjoy showing you what they have a real local market
not too far from pratunam market
not too much collection not so far from the center nice price recommend to come and get some new clothes
not too repetative deffenitly would recommend everyone to go here it is like the other gyms in the street expensive 700b for a private session but its worth te money
nothing much in this mall small mall with limited choice things are also not cheap not worth going
nothing nice about this street filthy night clubs everywhere with women in underwear offering you to go to ping pong shows
nothing special just another place for shopping souvenirs n eating very small place
nothing special or professional about this place the shop is nothing more than a filthy hangout run by an snoody kiteboarding kid piotr worth a look around before making a decision cheers
noticed blanc bespoke tailors great quality and extremely efficient a wide range of materials and talked through the costs and options of each

prices are more double than the open market for clothes and food over the street example 450 instead of 200 thb for beach dress before the negotiations started just go across the street to the market
prices are nominal no one forces you to shop bit difficult to find if you are going buy yourself
prices outside the shop as 99usd but as soon as you walk in
prices reasonable bu make sure you bargain and check out other tailors for comparison
prices were more expensive than uk but there was a lot of choice food court was very cheap though with loads of choice
pricing and service at a major san francisco department store ugh
prior to our trip to bangkok i did a lot of research on the internet on tailors in bangkok specifically those who cater for female fashion bangkok bazaar popped up numerous times
probably because there is a similar market on mbk and the prices are higher than
probably due to the opening of the jungceylon shopping center so
probably the most quaint and certainly the quietest walking street we have been to plenty of tasty food stalls at very cheap prices well worth a visit
professional and fit perfectly we had many demands for fitting and he completed everything highly recommend this tailor

quality and price to be great the lady who owns the shop was lovely and not too pushy
quality and price we strongly recommend this tailor max is allways very kind and service minded

quiet night market as the foreigners are few at this time of year some neat stalls with hand made jewellery etc but
quite beautiful and charming ancient shopping center for those who like style and ambiance from the colonial era o p place shopping centre is well worth a visit it is from another era bangkok art biennial 2018 have several contemporary art installations here 19 10 2018 03 01 2019
quite new and nothing much to shop mostly fashion and handcrafting don t bother to try the food street
quite old mall but still a lot of people there i love the rattan bag here grab one for souvenir and few things more
quite possibly the best experience i have ever had at a tailor prices are very fair especially given the quality they were able to meet all of my specific requirements and alteration requests
raj is a great tailor and a really friendly host i ordered three suits
raj is the best tailor
raj service at alex fashion is professional at tailor suiting the suit for my wedding i like the cutting and service and will recommend to my friends thanks

rather than a true floating market
read a lot of good reviews about this market
read up on this shopping centre and thought i would take kids looked like fun it said it opened at 12
really chill market with plenty of stalls and beer bars reminds me much more of chiangmai than bangkok costs tend to be more sensible here and an excellent number of foods there is a pork tendon soup that the locals dine at
really enjoyed shopping in this thai government owned store the selection and range of souvenirs and crafts is fantastic we bought loads of presents to bring back home including some really nice wooden salad servers
really enjoyed the day on the urban oasis trip with q as my guide the local markets on saturday were fantastic with fresh traditional thai food everywhere q was a fantastic guide with an easy going personality and great sense of humor q is also

sam is there with a warm professional welcome his shop is equally welcoming and well stocked sam clearly knows what he s doing and
same same but boring if you are going to make a special trip to the platinum fashion mall do not bother
same things as all the other markets only more expensive add the need for a boat and the taxi there it really is not worth it except for the novelty factor really a complete waste of time

small shop with ac as a trans person
small shopping and dining plaza
small shopping mall with very few shops
small stalls as well as up market thai and western restaurants
smaller and a less crowded than the saturday walking street great exercise love to buy the little round sai oua sausages on a string mostly vegetarian
smallish mall compared to the other cavernous ones in the area so
so a tailored suit was the best option i cannot reccommend best phuket patong tailor enough
so cloths never fit me correctly they took a piece of wonderful fabric and made a shirt
so communication was easy i had some shirts made as well as some travel shorts and pants with some specific customizations his experience shows
so down to earth he told me he was a tailor and i was looking for some new threads for work i was a little skeptical at first because
so expected it to be busier than it was one third farmers market
so friendly made me and the mrs such cool suit and dress came from new zealand stayed at the swissotel and got a few things made excellent quality and a cool thing todo with the mrs laurent and rachel thankyou guys yeoooowwwwww
so get a proper shoes and be ready to get dirty second half is ok and the view is very nice trail to princess lagoon is closed under the fine

so i did as the instructions said and met the tour at their business location on the 17th floor of some plaza

so nice custom shirts are great
so pleased to find ram tailor house and manu still at thavorn beach spa resort had dresses made 2 yrs ago and this time had tops
so prices are similar or same as the other central mall nevertheless if you want to avoid crowd in siam area
so regular shirts never fit me and they
so some trails were a bit slippy but with sturdy walking shoes there were no spills it took a bit longer but was
so the shop was really appealing we found some girl s dresses and a handmade bag
so visiting tailors has become a hobby the fitting here was great and a huge amount of fabrics are available it takes a leap of faith to gave a suit sent to another continent
so we arrived at 12 to find it opens at 6pm so thinking it is more of a night spot then shopping mall shame was
so we feel like inside the show but this show located at show dc shopping mall
so we made several trips to the 7 11 to buy beer soda snack way cheaper than the hotel there is also a jim thompson store if your looking for high quality thai silks souvenir shop prices
so we went there to just go and buy some essentials and also to look for some other good shopping options it really is just as good as any other street market in
so while walking through the night bazaar we could hear live singing and some awesome voices and couldn t resist entering and to our happiness the place was the most happening good ambience lovely designs styling and interiors this place totally rocked the shops and the
soi opsion 2 is where you will find this little shop we had shopped around for bags everywhere for kata to patong and found the range
some fruit and bags of spices add to the flavor of this market
some market shopping or a few drinks at a girly bar
some of the stores quote a higher price so when you bargain for a lower price
some people even say it is the best shop in thailand may
some shirts and a leather coat made up all are awesome the shirts i wear and wash every week and they are still in great condition the suit is so nice and expensive looking the
some shirts and a pair of pants made at the wall street tailor they have quickly become my favourite clothes to wear to work and the highest praise that i can give is that i was
some souvenirs the same as other markets but we also saw new things such as candle lights made of recycled tins we thought the range of wraps scarves was better than other markets
somewhat hidden by the souvenir market that has grown as a tarpaulin city in front of it atmosphere 1 5 an afterthought the man selling the banana pan crepes out front is
son is pleased husband ordered another 5 business shirts with white collars and cuffs
sorry the title s a bit too stretchy but i figured it should be descriptive enough to send you there so lemme give ya the location details best way to get there go to central festival mall on the beach rd
sounds and scents of the floating market were amazing the
souvenirs and other items have sale second hand tshirts and shirts

the floating market was beautiful
the food bazaar and the food court provides halal foods the alternative for halal food premises
the food court on the ground level is amazingly good value made up to look like a floating market
the food court specially
the food court upstairs is crowded with a busy atmosphere food was also average even
the gentleman in the shop was very curtious towards me as i removed my shoes before i entered his shop it used to be the custom in thailand but very few visitors do it now due to the numbers he
the gentleman owner is really a good person and excellent tailor they seem to do all the tailoring in house that is not true for the most of thai tailors the prices are a bit higher than elsewhere but the result is worth of every penny

the hotel was only 5 minutes walk from the seacon square mall big it is big with lots of shops and stalls and restaurants and food courts and a cinema it is not touristy so you will probably be the only westerner in here enjoy
the issue is the tourist trap surrounding the markets in the ping pong shows you are constantly bombarded by men with poorly detailed signs for  ping pong  or  pussy shows  they are a trap and
the krabi night market is a happening place it is bustling with activity numerous food stalls that serve all kinds of cuisine you just need to choose they have live bands playing to entertain people it is bang opposite the beach so the view is breathtaking
the largest thai style market in rayong their jaws dropped when they saw the extent of the fruit and vegetables on
the liab duan night market is worth a visit
the main tenants are the old carrefour big c which is a department store think kmart walmart and supermarket combined and homepro which is a hardware homewares store carrefour has everything from mobile phones
the mall bangkapi are the two of my favorite malls seacon has more variety on the inside the mall has more life on the outside it is the the number one neighborhood in my book with chinatown or yaowarat
the mall is beautiful it is well spread located on the opposite side of central world and just beside the big c it is presently fairly quiet and some of the floors look deserted many shops are yet to be opened up or occupied the
the mall is great
the mall is located next to weekend night market
the mall provides free shuttle bus services and there is a tourist lounge you can take shower there and use their locker services however

the market is close to bobae tower and is best if you want to buy very cheap clothes in amounts of 12 items or more the market opens early in the morning at 4am and closes by 6pm there is no night market at bo
the market is located nearby esplanade mall
the market is near the hotel we stayed there have alomsot everything at the market
the market is nice and clean with variety of shops
the market was a lot of fun with all kinds of different authentic dishes being prepared very cheap and you could get anything from bugs to taro balls great way to eat cheap
the market was recommended from hotel staff where we were staying in karon it was a 500 baht trip each way by taxi but well worth the experience the vibe was awesome with people everywhere but spaces where you could escape the chaos it s only
the markets are super cheap and it is great for buying gifts to take back home if you eat food there make sure they make it fresh for you would not recommend families with young children go there or you will have to carry them everywhere due to
the mature gentlemen who own and run this establishment are a father and son who have been making fine quality men s clothes for decades all fabric is pre washed and shrunk the garments are of very high quality
the meeting spot of a pink store belongs to a chain make sure you go to the store in the instructions the guide waited for me outside my tour turned from a group to a private because i was the only customer this had pluses
the monument shows us the two sisters ya chan and ya mook standing in the heart of the busy street
the morning market is smelly as they sell everythings inside
the mosque is located quite near to the floating market
the most people in the market are thais not a lot of farangs we walked also the streets in this nice old smal city and were very happy to see old wood houses typically thai for lunch you will find a lot of good seafood
the museum is well worth a visit beautifully laid out with much information on each family type of shells truly worth a visit the shop above has all sorts and the lady follows
the nepalese tailor lady who has taken over takes good efforts and the products are impeccably made value for money is also definitely with the visit its our second time there and we will be back
the new landmark boutique is one of our first trip if we are in bangkok since many years we will go over to this two tailors an we are happy
the next building to the platinum fashion mall
the night market in the city of surat thani is nothing to write home about slightly below average i ended up eating at a restaurant at the end of the market towards the river
the night market is adjacent to chao fah pier krabi several food stalls provide variety of thai cuisine we had dinner on 09 dec 18 other than food
the night market starts at the main road going through town and goes to and around the lake it is a very relaxed place and sells lots of different foods clothes souvenirs etc definatly worth visiting
the night market which is next to palladium pratunam the berkeley hotel pratunam it is not crowded and very nice to walk around suggested to have dinner here
the night markets are ok
the number of options available for custom tailored suits is endless in bangkok how is one supposed to choose call it luck or call it a blessing
the only minus i found was that their cafe shop only sells snacks and drinks which contain high amount of sugar why it s a place for
the only saving grace for this place is that it is a night market as such
the outlet has a very limited assortment of goods the prices are higher than in other stores selling silk cotton products air conditioned space
the outlook of the shop may not catch any attention of yours perry and his brother are both customer friendly they do not just want your business for this once
the owner of this shop is taking the necessary time to make a perfect on measurements suit the time to take your measurements properly
the owner was a thai he was really lovely and tried his best to suit my need i ordered linen suits and 2 shirts
the owners have expanded this place and there are many new and nicer halls now there are more retail shops now and you can find starbucks here too the food court in the basement has a wide variety of food
the palladium mall
the pants were way too wide even though i specifically asked for a slim cut same goes for the jacket
the part i am talking about is the food court area on the second floor
the place is certainly can not be compared to the floating market in bangkok but it is somewhere to spend your time but shopping can be expensive in this place there should be more stores open by now the food court is very nice we
the place is like a scam do not visit there people are rude things are expensive i get the same shirt at patong for 60baht while they are selling at 120baht asked for discount and they say i will not get such a cheap price at
the place is quite huge for a night market having locals selling bags
the place is well maintained a few minutes walk from the phaya thai sky train station the palace building is old with antique items shoes are not allowed inside old buildings a silent place there were not many tourists on the day we went which
the plaza is a small area containing 2 very good restaurants and a small gift shop and antique shop
the price is reasonable and the customer service is terrific i was a customer of kenny s when the tailor operated under a different name zara fashion and make a point of visiting to
the prices for drinks and food are decent and the new shop is awesome as well spending a lot of time there on
the quality of tailoring and materials you receive are not what they show you in the store my jacket was so poor i did not even wear it once straight to the bin
the quality of the fabrics and the professional service were outstanding the team did a really great job i had five trousers and five shirts made and everything fit just perfectly i can highly recommend getting measured for some great quality clothes
the reason for the poor rating is lack of concern for customer safety no life jacket issued when requested details of the safety issue after the dinner on the beach
the right place to shop for thai clothing
the salesman and tailor his team provided the best service and helped us pick the best cut
the seashell museum is located underground of the building thb200 admission fee is a bit expensive souvenir shop is free to visit offers number of selection
the second highest is for sport equipment and the following floors are clothes for male and female for those who wanted to buy sport equipment
the service and fabric quality are second to none the staff were very friendly and not at all pushy i came here after seeing reviews on trip advisor and would highly recommend the best tailor very much in love with the suit i got and
the service i received was phenomenal and the quality of the suits and shirts surpasses all of my expectations i will definitely use them again
the service i was greeted with was 5 stars the owner of the store helped me choose a suit style
the service was friendly but the measurements were poor the alteration was not good after first fitting and took them a long while to get back to me after the second fit that i took the clothes and left
the service was very friendly and of course the suits i ordered fitted perfectly my wife had her dress tailored beautifully with hand made details the price was reasonable i highly recommend this store to anyone looking for a professional work
the service was very good we wanted a new suit for work reasen and we are very happy with the result we can recommend this store
the shirts and my dress your care and patience is much appreciated we highly recommend your shop fantastic value and the best

the shop locate in middle of market
the shop still sells at the retail pricing if you
the shop welcomes you with a
the shopping mall is equipped with variety of choices with variety of price tag suggest a newbie to start by shopping here first it is a shopping mall
the shopping mall is nothing special but the food court is very nice we enjoyed everything we ordered and it was average priced worth a visit for a meal
the short review the clothes you want with quality that lasts in the time you need this is my 3rd time over the last 6 years i have received clothes from mr paul i have purchased suits
the shoulder pads on my jacket were too big
the siam discovery is easy to get to by catching the overhead bts train and get off at siam station a large number of numerous shops a lot are up market expensive items walk to nearby mbk and numerous malls shopping malls
the sleeves were too short emailed johnny and he told me to mail the shirts back
the small shopping mall is fine but avoid basil thai kitchen seems more a fast food not genuine thai kitchen poor english speaking skills
the son also unlike the others shop
the stadium is located near the heart of commercial shopping area and is a site of many sport activities however
the staff in the shop were very helpful after a period of time after viewing and discussing many pieces i selected a piece
the staff was smoking all the time also in the shop
the staff were very friendly and the equipment provided swimming shoes
the store is exceptional when it comes to quality
the store offers around 600batt per person including shipping and dining vouchers with no shopping obligation
the street food here is amazing try the omelette rice
the street market was as lively as ever during my recent visit but i did note that it had shrunk in geographical terms swank new hotel and mall developments appear to have evicted them their vicinity be this as it may
the streetwalk is full of pub and bar even the souvenir shop and restaurants are very expensive because the target group is tourists
the sunday night bazaar was slightly better than when i last visited some three years ago
the super cheap stores are found mostly all over in thailand and can be compared to makro when it comes to cheap priced groceries
the supermart offers a variety of food poducts as well as organic section price is much higher than central phuket mall boat avenue is a lovely and quiet place to chill and dine though a pity
the ta prachan amulet market is a hive of activity anytime of the day we get there by boat
the tailor
the tailor came with a lot of fabric patterns
the tailor dave were a true pro he didn t force is to enter his shop like most salesmen in phuket
the tailor house in chiang mai has been a great experience for us we entered the shop on raj wethi road on the 30 12 2013 very close to new years eve with the wishes of having two jackets for our two teenage boys and one
the tailor shops in bangkok mostly operated by indians or middle east people taken the measurement on tuesday
the tailor was extremely helpful and offered a lot of good tailoring advice when the my first cut was slightly bigger than ideal
the tailor was very friendly and helpfu the biggest different between the other tailors in phuket is
the tailor went straight back did all the necessary adjustments for me free of charge the service is definitely recommended
the tailors are not pushy with their sales talk they will meet you at your budget with suitable material and style
the tailors are very good
the team at moonriver were great and i was really happy with their input into my dress design timing of delivery was perfect and i was very happy with the final product
the ticket to enter the market was 1000 2500 bth the products were very expensive the water was too dirty the man who had the boat was stopping only at the shops he knew it was a different experience but i think it is overstated
the tiny market situated just by the road side care to be taken avoiding turning a bit earlier since ig just passed the road junction no parking available
the tita gallery coffee shop provided an excellent venue the staff served us quickly with coffee while the fans kept us cool the coffee was reasonably priced also and the staff was friendly
the train running through the middle of a market seeing is believing
the training was tailored to my level i box a little they have a nice gym and are actively improving and building new stuff the location is near thong sala pier so it s very central and easily accessible after a
the usual type of shopping mall you will get with more locals brands the popular rod fai night market is located behind
the variety of this sunday night market is impressive there is so much to see
the winter coat and the cheongsam dress tom s tailor has made for me are now irreplaceable and timeless items in my closet beautiful
the year before i also had a jacket and pants made this time i had 3 suits
their supermarket and food court were also amazing
then go visit anthony s boutique this was my first time in phuket thailand and our hotel in karon recommended anthony s boutique for tailor suits wow
then head here boyce s work is fantastic every item he is tailored for me has been a perfect fit
then look no further khym at tsunami tailor is a wonderful man to deal with and the work they produce is very professional i had a jacket
then they were finally open i wanted a jacket and dress i had 4 days to make the
then this mall is
there are 100 s of street food vendors all offering just about anything you
there are a few shops attached to a hotel no outdoor stalls and no market to speak of the dinosaurs are nice
there are a great many tailors in hua hin who are always looking for business however we have been to this outlet for three years running and they always exceeded my expectations a lovely family business
there are a lot of clothes stalls and food stalls here however
there are a lot of shopping mall
there are a lot of tailor shops on this little stretch i cannot vouch for most of them
there are better night markets then patpong one street with the same products
there are expensive restaurants at rain hill the plaza is a midsize mall there is a underground parking garage the plaza is beautiful the food at wagyuism rain hill was delicious but expensive
there are few places in the world today where tailor business is honored the price and quality are certainly not balanced here i got a very high quality suit at an unbelievably favorable price for me it was definitely an emotional purchase
there are few spots in central bangkok where you can enjoy a green space with benches near shady trees along the river this park near phra sumen fort is one of them often there is some breeze and most of the time it is quiet
there are lots of market stalls selling various items and handicrafts there are also many good food stalls in the centre we found a huge seating area that had live music
there are lots of stores and restaurants and classes in this section of this mall
there are many good food stalls good tasting local coffee shop in the center of food court at less than b50 i love the agape coffee the coffee stall signature mix there is good car park spaces both indoor
there are many japanese restaurants at the mall there are 7 eleven and tesco lotus the food court is acceptable the mall is connected to the mrt subway

there are many tailor shops in chaweng
there are many tailors based in bangkok
there are many tailors in bangkok but ckk suit are the best in my view i live and work in london and during my stay in bkk after a very good first set of 5 shirts i went ahead and ordered total of 15 customs
there are nothing special in the museum but the tea shop is nice and tasty
there are plenty of food and coffee options that are better than the standard offerings for a thai mall
there are pros and cons to buying meat at star fresh market on the downside
there are some good restaurants however and a grocery store for buying grocery back to hotel
there are some really cool original stores
there are stores
there are too many stalls selling fake brands and not enough hand made authentic crafts on the plus side there s plenty of street food to try if you re feeling adventurous
there is a mall which designed in scandinavia theme also public house zone is plenty of international foods in front of mall
there is a myriad of suit tailors in phuket and ive previously had suits made that just dont stand up to australian conditions i am writing this review on a train
there is also shopping and restaurants for after skating they have rental skates and lessons
there is an abundance of tailor shops to choose from in bangkok and especially in the sukhumvit area this makes it hard to decide which one to go with many stores might seem credible due to their fancy and elaborate store fronts which make them
there is live shows and stand ups also there are seafood restaurants and shops for goodies you will need to exchange money for cash coupons but there are no money exchange so be sure to have enough cash for the market
there is many different buffets at this hotel 74 76 floor buffet 81st and 82nd buffet we did the 81st thinking it was more classy and intimate got dressed up nicely thinking it was a dress code this whole place is an overcrowded zoo with huge tour
there is not much here advisable to only come if you have spare time to kill it is quite near to the saturday night market
there is nothing as special in this world as having clothes made just for you and ben and charlie and their staff make you feel pretty special whilst they are making sure that each garment fits you and you only they are pleasant and accommodating
there is really no reason for a tourist or someone travelling on business to go out of the way for this shopping mall except for the foot massage place in the back or possibly buy something at the pharmacy
there must be thousands of bespoke and custom made tailors around bangkok
there open everyday except wednesday they have a very nice local market along the canal and they
there r many tailor shops out there
there was plenty choice of high quality fabrics and amit gave good advice i bought pants and pair of shirts i am almost 2 meters tall and everything fits perfectly
there were a lot of different dishes that were eaten at a local market we did not see a single tourist on our route we also got to see part
therefore very good alternative to fisherman s village evening market mainly a spectrum of food stalls
therefore you are the prey he forced us to buy very bad special shoes for 1
these clothes are awesome the best shop which i have ever seen here we tried several clothiers here and david with tony or other way round are the best we will indeed order new costumes here next time quality
these gentlemen are very professional and knowledgeable tailors they were precise and accurate with the suit fittings and final suit product i recommend my family
these guys are great three suits and two shirts in 24 hours you sure they are legit and i can definitely stop and see
these guys are simply top notch never before had i had shirts tailored to perfection like they do i am sending in another order right after writing this review
these guys are the best they give an honest price and don t try to rip you off like some of the tailors on khao san rosd it took a day for skirt suits and jacket that i need as a teacher nice blouse too listen
these guys did a great job on altering my husbands trousers he is very fussy and was very please with the quality of the alteration and recommends this tailor

they are all affordable and you may even get a small discount other than shopping for

they don t need to stand outside the shop trying to
they got me a tailored suit within one day as my return flight was the day after it fits and feels great definately recommend checking it out if your in need of a suit
they have a small shop on the susie street
they have everything from local and traditional items to anything else you shopping
they have fakes it is thailand c mon you want high end stuff visit central 21 a block away food court was dead but excellent food first offerred price for goods was on par with the negotiated price at other markets so
they have no clue how to make women dresses even with a pattern the only place i can wear the dress is in my kitchen everyone especially women please
they should not call themselves custom tailor
they speak perfect english and are excellent tailors highly recommended they also keep
they take you through their little shop and into a room to hear their sales pitch for extract
they try to scare us into buying their shoes from the beginning this is understandable however
they understand my concern and try their best to pull it off mr tailor become my go to tailor from now on
they were going to send a jacket in the mail later never sent it
things that i did not see at chiang mai saturday or sunday street market it shows the
things to eat while browsing at good prices the rest were clothing t shirt
think there s a bigger market at night great place
third time visiting alex s fashion always my go to place to get my supply of shirts for the year service is always extraordinary and fast turnarounds times there s a great variety and selection of fabric to choose from so it s easy to find a style
this art store is closed and appears to have been closed for some time the previous owner is living in siam reap

this guy was mazing from start to finish his clothes and expertise are second to none the quality is exactly the same a designer he even made sure that the sizes and cut was correct
this happened to be right outside my hostel at wua lai street if you like to look at knick knacks such as carved soap
this house is an opportunity to see inside one of old phuket town s mansions the house is in a very run down state it is beautiful original facade shoes terrible wear and tear

tour around hua hin markets temples and places of interest well worth it too get your bearings and some great views from chopstick hill

try some great street food snacks

typical local thai street market it really depends what you are looking for if you have been to jatujak and hope that this market would be something like that
typical mall of central variety
typical mall with obvious brands and services plus cinema theatre
unfortunately all staffs are very unfriendly and unprofessional once they start to know you and you don t tip them they become cold the equipment store is not to recommend to go to
unfortunately this one time hh tourist attraction has ceased operations the name was a misnomer because visitors walked around a body of water into various stores hopefully it can be infused with new investors to make it thrive as the property now just sits vacant
until i had shopped most of siam square and mbk and could not find anything to fit then i walked past mr sunil of suit up bespoke tailor on the 6th floor of mbk
until you get inside a shop i spent about 20 min here i m glad i went because all the

which came out perfectly nice and in shape the materials are good and it fitted perfectly well will definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good tailor shop in bangkok
which i decline to name i strongly recommend getting custom shirts made here my sport coat is
which is a mix of clothes
which is not listed in search huge coffee shop filled with people waiting fo their orders overpriced under quality coffee that takes forever to get tried
which there is the entry through supermarket which sell all stuff really good price consider from the number of local there but a large variety of tourist products too there are several food store there
while an incredible selection of inexpensive fresh flowers is certainly the main draw of bangkok s flower market
while i ordered 5 shirts and a coat we are very happy with the quality and speed of
while i was on holidays in thailand with my family we got to know kasper from w boss i would highly recommend anyone to this store
while pantip plaza has an it focus
while the mall provides so many things like other mall
while the treatment my our tour guide was spectacular and if i could give them 10 stars i would but this review is directed more towards the market itself
while we did not go into every shopping mall in pattaya of those we did go in this was the best there was a good selection of shops and eating areas to keep us occupied and the layout and design was good as well
while we flew to thailand we talked about making a suit one day later we saw the first shop and go in it he speak perfect english and he speak even some words in german we got top service and advice the suit that you
who chatted to us throughout the trip about thailand and the specific area first visit was to a local food market
who claimed to have just shopped there another american in the store said
who didn t try to drag you into his shop like others nearby we had our suits made in no time
who gave me lots of good advice i finally settled on a cashmere 3 piece suit with a white shirt and it was the cheapest quote
who is running the place is a bespoke tailor with
who literally pull you into the store
who randomly walked by this shop in the search for a suit it started by hearing about the prices for one suit
who wants nice dress or suit the owner is really kind android good person tom
who will not stop until perfection i went here for 1 shirt
who would not want to go on a shopping spree in bangkok every tourist wants to go shopping by themselves and ended up regreting because it costs them too much or they did not find the cheaper spots well if you want your shopping tour efficient
wholesale flower market interesting to see how they transform the flowers into special arrangements that can be used as offerings at the temple vegetables
why do people bother to visit all these so called tailors in bangkok i bought 3 suits there and i am happy with all of them of course
why galaxy tailor as they provide the suits for you
wife and i are advanced divers nice looking shop and great t shirts right at the start our pickup was over an hour late so in rome etc etc no

with a helmut is dressed in western clothes and stands firmly in front of the gates to lumpini
with a huge variety of beautiful flowers and blooming bushes the maintenance of the palace and the gardens it s perfect take a quick espresso at the little coffee shop which
with a lot of tailor shops in bangkok it gets difficult to choose i have been to many stores in the past and i recently tried out de fabiano as i needed a new suit for work and it was close by my workplace honestly
with an actual market on the first floor instead a place to buy fruits and vegetables and such we go there regularly
with children in the age of 5 26 they had a plan that was tailored for all they took care of the hotel reservations in the park in the lake and did
with competent counseling and customer service visit them they know what they do needed shirts and trousers tailor made at nice prices thumbs up
with friday being the night when all the permanent market stall holders are there we went on wednesday as we were leaving friday morning and there were still loads of stalls selling traditional thai carvings and
with lots of street foods and restaurants local thai
with no water in front of this store every day what sort of life is this this baby
with once a year opportunities do not fall for this they just want you to get to this store to pressure you in buying
with so many tailors to choose from in bangkok
with some addition of thai style most obvious western plates and some basic clothes and accessories vast majority of visitors are locals form local neighborhood
with special exhibition this place was worth a visit otherwise it was so dry with only few collection items in the shop the facilities were in poor condition from steep stairs to locked toilets which half of them were not in a workable condition travelled
with the words this is a tailors
within 2 days here tailor had crafted a beautifully fitted jacket far a wedding next month

worth a visit to bangkok shop at over 400 stores and eat at over 100 restaurants my favorite is the floating market and the huge movie theatre there is plenty of parking and you are on the river so you can take a river taxi
worth going but combersome to get to need to get a seperate shuttle approx 1 5 km fomr the entrance random sewer smell wafting through food markets is nausiating at best in one aisle
worth the effort great people super baked goods near warorot market they have mostly everything i really love their bakery a must try
worth the visit does get a little crowded as expected even in the low season not a difficult hike to the falls but you want shoes with excellent grip life jackets and bathrooms available in parking lot which was handy
would appreciate gaysorn shopping center in addition to that
